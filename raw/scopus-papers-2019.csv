6195,Chaperones | PDB | Protein functions | Protein structure,0,Bascos N.,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Thirty years ago a class of proteins was found to prevent the aggregation of Rubisco. These proteins’ ability to prevent unwanted associations led to their being called chaperones. These chaperone proteins also increased in expression as a response to heat shock, hence their label as heat shock proteins (Hsps). However, neither label encompasses the breadth of these proteins’ functional capabilities. The term “unfoldases” has been proposed, as this basic function is shared by most members of this protein family. Onto this is added specializations that allow the different family members to perform various cellular functions. This current article focuses on the resolved structural bases for these functions. It reviews the currently available molecular structures in the Protein Data Bank for several classes of Hsps (Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp104). When possible, it discusses the complete structures for these proteins, and the types of molecular machines to which they have been assigned. The structures of domains and the associated functions are discussed in order to illustrate the rationale for the proposed unfoldase function.",SCOPUS_ID:85076316607,A history of molecular chaperone structures in the protein data bank,2-s2.0-85076316607,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-12-02,10.3390/ijms20246195,,16616596,24,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076316607,20,31817979.0,re,Review

,Quality of service | Software defined networks | Traffic management | Value-based utility | Wireless sensor nodes,0,Alipio M.,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Data transmitted among wireless sensor nodes are generated from sensing physical events with diverse traffic types. These data have to reach their destinations with a specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. With the increasing usage of sensors in various Internet of Things applications, there is a need to address the traffic management for handling these critical data while satisfying their respective QoS requirements. In this work, we implemented a traffic management mechanism using Value-based Utility (VBU) model that utilizes network packet statistics to cope with QoS requirement of each sensor data. The mechanism ensures that the demands of each sensor data are satisfied by allocating queue resources based on a utility function. The function defines an expectation range and the state where minimal requirements are met for each sensor. We evaluated the performance of the mechanism over a simple low-cost software-defined testbed with different sensor data type having different QoS requirements. Results show that each sensor node achieved the level of satisfaction based on their required utility function both in an ideal testbed scenario and in an actual indoor deployment.",SCOPUS_ID:85069598217,Value-based utility implementation in software-defined testbed for sensor data traffic management,2-s2.0-85069598217,GCOE,undefined,"Gokongwei College of Engineering, De La Salle University",0,False,S0167739X19307873,Journal,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.future.2019.07.041,,0167739X,,737-746,Future Generation Computer Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069598217,101,,ar,Article
,Logic controller | Plc | Three-phase transformer | Trainer kit | Transformer banking,0,Minoza A.,"© 2019 by the authors. This research will bridge the gap between theoretical concepts of transformer banking and its actual operation without risking the safety of the students as well as the initiating personnel for the laboratory exercises. In electrical engineering, the concept of transformers is very essential to the success of engineering students in terms of electrical engineering applications. Thus, learning the basic of transformers should be taught properly in universities. However, the danger of dealing with high voltages in a range of 220 Vac and above should be taken seriously. To address this problem, a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) will be integrated into the system. Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an industrial solid-state computer that monitors inputs and outputs and makes logic-based decisions for automated processes or machines. The integration of PLC into the system configuration of any transformer banking served as the protection system. Students will be able to learn on how to configure the four (4) different types of transformer banking, namely, (a) delta-wye; (b) wye-delta; (c) delta-delta; and (d) wye-wye. The interconnection of the system is made possible with the aid of relays. The problem with transformer banking is whenever students misconfigured the connection there is a big chance of damaging the equipment and hurting the user. With this trainer, the equipment is being protected along with the user. The trainer developed in this research will be a good equipment to fully grasp the concept of transformers and best way for the students to expand their knowledge towards electrical engineering.",SCOPUS_ID:85075626464,Programmable logic controller (PLC) protected transformer banking trainer kit for electrical engineering education,2-s2.0-85075626464,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-12-01,10.18178/ijiet.2019.9.12.1329,,,12,933-937,International Journal of Information and Education Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075626464,9,,ar,Article
104773,B-stocks | Holding period returns | Investment | Portfolio selection | Short-selling,1,Chang K.,"© 2019 This study exploits the extra information provided by behavioral stocks (B-stocks) and proposes portfolio selection models that produce profitable portfolios which can outperform traditional investment benchmarks (market index, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds). Using the embedded holding period (T-day) information of a B-stock, in order to maximize the expected effect (cumulative abnormal return CAR ≥ 1%), this study proposes a buy and hold strategy such that B-stocks are bought when their respective causes are spotted and held until their respective T-days are reached. In addition, in performing the back-tests the actual transaction costs are considered to represent more realistic investments. Short-selling is also considered to provide a more flexible investment such that some B-stocks are shorted when causes are spotted and wait until their respective T-days are reached to exploit the expected effect (CAR≤−1%). The resulting portfolios are then compared to traditional benchmarks. Overall, this study addresses three issues that were not addressed by previous works on B-stocks. These issues are: (1) having portfolios that are profitable even after all transactions costs are considered; (2) identifying short-sell B-stocks for consideration of short-selling in the portfolio selection; and (3) generating portfolios that outperform traditional investment benchmarks.",SCOPUS_ID:85071193491,Behavioral stock portfolio optimization considering holding periods of B-stocks with short-selling,2-s2.0-85071193491,MOST,103-2221-E-033-023,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",0,False,S0305054819302151,Journal,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.cor.2019.104773,,03050548,,,Computers and Operations Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071193491,112,,ar,Article
,Eye movement | Stereoscopic | Structural equation modeling,3,Lin C.,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. The current study applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the interrelationship among index of difficulty (ID), environment, saccade duration (SD), revisited fixation duration (RFD), number of fixation (NF), pupil size (PS), eye gaze accuracy (AC), and symptoms simultaneously. SD, RFD, NF, PS, and AC were measured by utilizing the Tobii eye tracker system. Twelve participants were recruited to perform multi-directional tapping task using within-subject design with two different environments (2D screen display and 3D stereoscopic display) and six different levels of ID. SEM showed that ID had significant direct effects on SD and RFD while environment was found had significant direct effects on SD, RFD, PS, AC, and symptoms. Among selected eye movement measures, NF was found to be the best predictor of AC and PS was found to be the best predictor of symptoms. In addition, RFD was also found to be a good predictor of symptoms. Our results found that higher AC was achieved by projecting the image in the 2D screen display with higher ID and it resulted in higher SD and higher NF. Regarding the symptoms, our results found that lower symptoms were achieved by projecting the image in the 2D screen display with lower ID and it resulted in lower PS, and lower RFD.

1,Migration network | Persistent homology | Remittance network,1,Ignacio P.,"© 2019, The Author(s). Pattern detection in network models provides insights to both global structure and local node interactions. In particular, studying patterns embedded within remittance and migration flow networks can be useful in understanding economic and sociologic trends and phenomena and their implications both in regional and global settings. We illustrate how topo-algebraic methods can be used to detect both local and global patterns that highlight simultaneous interactions among multiple nodes, giving a more holistic perspective on the network fabric and a higher order description of the overall flow structure of directed networks. Using the 2015 Asian net migration and remittance networks, we build and study the associated directed clique complexes whose topological features correspond to specific flow patterns in the networks. We generate diagrams recording the presence, persistence, and perpetuity of patterns and show how these diagrams can be used to make inferences about the characteristics of migrant movement patterns and remittance flows.",SCOPUS_ID:85059688337,Tracing patterns and shapes in remittance and migration networks via persistent homology,2-s2.0-85059688337,,undefined,"Graduate College, University of Iowa",1,True,,Journal,2019-12-01,10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0179-z,,,1,,EPJ Data Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059688337,8,,ar,Article

This issue was addressed by developing Low Impact Development (LID) practices to deliver better hydrologic function and improve the environmental, economic, social and cultural outcomes. This study developed a modeling software to simulate and optimize bioretentions among LID in a given watershed. The model calculated a detailed soil infiltration process in bioretention with hydrological conditions (e.g. unsaturated and saturated soil) and hydraulic facilities (e.g. riser and underdrain) and also generated an optimized plan using Flow Duration Curve (FDC). The optimization result from the simulation demonstrated that the location and size of bioretention, as well as the soil texture, are important elements for an efficient bioretention.

The researchers adopted the phases of Actor-Network Theory approach for the public senior high school teachers with the use of M-Learning technologies as pedagogy since most of them lack access in using different learning materials and textbooks. With this, the teachers find other ways on how to provide learning materials for their students. The study used free and open source educational software to support and sustain the needs of the students and one of the M-learning open source tools is Edmodo. Also, the teacher supplements the needs of the learners with the use of some technological devices such as mobile phone, tablet and desktop computers. The result of the study showed that it is moderately accepted in terms of using the free and open source Edmodo application. The respondents moderately accepted the use of such devices as an educational pedagogical strategy. Moreover, the satisfaction of ANT approach with the use of the m-learning technologies in the public senior high school students in terms of m-learning materials, activities and assessment was highly accepted with a total mean of 4.56.

All rights reserved. The Internet is intricately embedded in our everyday lives and has become a valuable source of information to support learning due to its accessibility and decreasing costs. However, the rising costs of healthcare resulted in students seeking medical information from online health websites contributing unnecessary stress to their academic lives. In developing economies, however, the overloaded information from the Internet brings forth severe risks to these individuals by exposing themselves to inaccurate and inappropriate information in addressing their perceived conditions and symptoms. Cyberchondria is the speculative escalation of anxieties about common health issues which is grounded on the assessment of online information to satisfy medical curiosity. The personality traits of nursing students in higher education are utilized to identify which among these traits can lead to cyberchondria by examining 207 responses through a structural equation model technique. Analysis of data reveals that the individual personality traits of conscientiousness and neuroticism are positively associated with cyberchondria.

The Department of Education (DepEd) states that from the 1.2 million SHS graduates as of the end of SY 2017-2018, around half are expected to proceed to college. This study aims to look at the effectiveness of the SHS program, in terms of preparing the students for higher education. Specifically, the study focused on students enrolled in an information technology education (ITE) degree program and how their SHS program contributed to readiness for college. The survey method was used to the first-year college students from both private and state universities.

,Computing education | Digital natives | IT education | K-12 education | Theory of reasoned action,0,Ebardo R.,"© 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved. The rising technology sector in the Philippines has called for a holistic structural reform in its educational system through the implementation of the K-12 program. As such, higher educational institutions are in constant quest to look for strategies to increase enrollment in their Information Technology programs. To be effective, educational institutions must understand individual perceptions towards pursuing an IT degree in higher education. This paper presents the results of a study among senior high school student, who are one of the first recipients of the newly implemented system of education. Using additional constructs to the established Theory of Reasoned Action, a survey instrument was deployed in two higher educational institutions and gathered a total of 431 responses. Using Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Model, results revealed that computer self-efficacy and job availability does not positively influence the attitude towards an IT degree at a significant level. The study also confirmed prior research that job salary and social image are primary factors that positively influence the attitude of students. Aligned with the findings of other research, attitude and social norms are strong predictors of the behavioral intention of students to pursue an IT degree.

This trajectory gives birth to various affordances which presents opportunities for research on how these tools can support learning beyond the walls of traditional classrooms by facilitating group collaboration. While prior studies focused on examining the technological factors in the use of collaboration tools, other researches revealed that social factors are equally important. In this paper, we contribute to the dearth of research in exploring social dimensions as antecedents of usage continuance of collaboration tools. A total of 168 students participated in an empirical study which revealed social influence and social presence as predictors of positive attitude towards instant messaging tools for collaboration. Further analysis of data establishes social influence as the strongest indicator of usage continuance. However, contrary to prior research, social influence does not predict social presence.

,Incubation Effect | LSTM | Physics Playground,0,Talandron-Felipe M.,"© 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved. Incubation Effect (IE) refers to the phenomenon where one gets stuck in a problem-solving activity, decides to take a break, and afterwards revisits the unsolved problem and eventually solves it. While studies on IE were all limited to traditional classroom activities, this research aimed to continue the study of IE in the context of a computer-based learning environment and find features that would predict the incidence of revisiting an unsolved problem and its positive outcome. A prior IE model was developed using a logistic regression but the hand-crafted features used were from aggregated data and do not reflect specific characteristics of students’ actions. Further analysis was conducted in this study and used a deep learning technique which significantly improved the performance of the IE model. In order to interpret the learned features of the neural network, a combination of dimension reduction, visualization technique, and clustering were used. It was found that the coarse-grained features are consistent with the fine-grained features but action level features were also discovered which provided more evidence that there was an improvement on how students tried to solve the problem after incubation.",SCOPUS_ID:85077693195,Leveraging LSTM in the fine-grained analysis of the Incubation Effect in Physics Playground,2-s2.0-85077693195,PCIEERD,undefined,"Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development",0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721431'}]",,,12-21,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077693195,1,,cp,Conference Paper

However, there is still limited knowledge about the code reading strategies used by students while performing bug finding task. In this paper, the author describes a summary of her research on novice programmer debugging skills using eye tracking data as a methodology. Eye tracking data were extracted and analyzed using visual effort metrics and sequential analysis of scanpaths using a clustering algorithm to determine common code reading patterns.

Twenty-four (24) Grade-11 senior high school students under the STEM track from a private university located in Quezon City took part in this study. Of the 24 participants who took the pre-test, only 23 proceeded with the eye-tracking test, where only 19 data were deemed treatable due to technical issues. This study examined different instantiations of mathematical blindness thru the lens of the Tripartite theory and with the help of the eye-tracking method that collected empirical data and aided in the investigation on how these instantiations manifested in participants’ mathematics problem-solving, particularly problems involving quadratic equations, ratio and proportion, geometry, and concept of speed.

All rights reserved. In most organizations, surveys are conducted for copious objectives. Surveys are traditions of collecting data that has become the voice of the customer relayed and conveyed anonymously or blatantly. Various learning institutions, mostly universities at large, has made it customary to allow students answer surveys intended to collect views on their overall assessment covering their satisfaction in the entire course as the semester concludes. In Jose Rizal University, student feedback is collected in various survey formats. One of which is called the Canvas Learning Experience survey that provides opportunity to the learners to comment on the proficiency of the implementation of the blended learning course. It seeks student comments on specific areas for improvement in the teaching and learning process. The conveyance of whether these students are immensely satisfied with their learning environment and experience matters mostly to the university treating them as customers and partners. One of the significant objectives of this research is to develop a blended learning feedback mining system that empowers the educational institution administration to inspect at the reproaches of their clients’ learning experience in the blended learning course and thus upgrade them accordingly. The conceptual framework of this research centers on catching and investigating criticism information from students’ perceptions basing from their qualitative comments using text mining. In turn, the framework will give the fundamental structure in the implementation of the feedback mining system that the university may utilize for addressing the results of the Canvas Experience survey.",SCOPUS_ID:85077680030,Mining student experience and feedback in social and professional issues in iT: Basis for understanding blended learning,2-s2.0-85077680030,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721448'}]",,,793-796,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077680030,2,,cp,Conference Paper
,Challenges | Computer Education | Higher Education | Open-Source Software | OSS Benefits | Value-Based Adoption,0,Trapero H.,"© ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings. All rights reserved. Open-Source Software (OSS) is computer software developed in a public collaborative manner with source codes available under a license that guarantees certain freedom. This includes the right to study, modify, and distribute the source code to any individual for any purpose without constraint or undue cost. It has gained much importance in the academic sector because it is best used for research, derivatives, analytics, statistics, and even the use of the Linux operating system is highly recommended. Academic institutions, particularly in emerging economies like the Philippines, are also under pressure to look for the lowest-cost solutions while having an effective course provision. However, several issues and challenges are identified, especially when it comes to its usability in terms of learnability, efficiency of use, memorability, and subjective satisfaction, among others. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the different factors that can influence students to appreciate the open-source software’s value and adoption in the classroom setting. The results of the study showed that enjoyment, technicality, and attribute have a significant correlation with perceived value while usefulness has no significant correlation with perceived value. Also, perceived value has a significant correlation with software adoption intention, while gender and age have no significant correlation with adoption intention. Therefore, enjoyment, technicality, and attribute are predictors of one’s perceived value of OSS. The students’ OSS adoption intention is also determined through the positive valuation of it which leads to adoption or continuous usage of it, whether for personal use or classroom use.",SCOPUS_ID:85077675706,Value-based adoption of open-source software in higher education: An empirical investigation,2-s2.0-85077675706,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721448'}]",,,237-245,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077675706,2,,cp,Conference Paper
,Adaptive learning | Educational game | Situated learning theory | Stealth assessment,0,Buenviaje W.,"© 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved. Situated learning theory argues that learning is embedded within an activity, context, and culture. It posits that students are more likely to learn if they have an exposure to the authentic context of the learning environment. Based loosely on this theory, Shape Shape Hooray is an adaptive educational game that aims to teach basic 3D geometric shapes by allowing basic education students associate 3D shapes to daily objects. As an adaptive game, this paper discusses the paths developed for different kinds of players (no prior/low prior, average, and high prior knowledge). A usability test was conducted to which a generally positive score was acquired. Various kinds of metrics (task success and task indicators) and the Systems Usability Scale (SUS) were also tested to find out the game’s impact on user experience and to evaluate possible design directions and improvements for Shape Shape Hooray. We found that respondents were highly impressed with the game’s usability, scoring 81.5 on the SUS. Future work will include educators’ testing on the game’s usability, testing of learning to students, and consultations with programmers for expert validation.",SCOPUS_ID:85077728109,A usability study on shape shape hooray: An adaptive educational game associating 3D geometric shapes to daily objects,2-s2.0-85077728109,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721431'}]",,,549-554,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077728109,1,,cp,Conference Paper

This paper looked at the relationship between the student’s technology identity and how it affects their performance in a web-based tutoring system over a 12-week period. Technology identity covers one’s beliefs on four areas: opportunities and constraints to use technology (access), technology skills (abilities), role of technology on one’s life (importance), and one’s own motivation to learn more about technology (opportunities). Results showed that access factors such as frequency of access, owning a computer at home, and owning a personal computer/laptop do have an impact on their ability to use computer applications. A significant difference was found in the number of problems completed (higher) among students who were able to frequently access and use a computer and the Internet for free in school. This could be an indication of the importance of the role of educational institutions to provide computer and Internet access to students who can’t afford to have their own at home or rent. Also, 99% of the students, including those who did not solve as many problems, viewed technology as an essential part in education, business, personal development, and their future profession. All (100%) the participants expressed willingness to learn more about technology. However, when it comes to the fourth are (opportunities), almost half (47%) believe that they don’t have sufficient opportunities and access to technology to be used in education.",SCOPUS_ID:85077710844,The Role of Technology Identity among Students in Rural Areas using a Web-based Tutoring System,2-s2.0-85077710844,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721431'}]",,,194-196,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077710844,1,,cp,Conference Paper

Functional Fixedness (FF) refers to a type of fixation which hinders an individual to use an object in an unfamiliar, atypical, and new ways aside from what had been previously learned about the object’s functionality. In a problem-solving activity, FF may delay or impede the process of finding a solution due to the inability to utilize the available materials and options presented. In this study, the incidence of FF in the context of computer programming was investigated. The students were given programming problems that require them to utilize a specific Java pre-defined method in a different manner from its basic and usual implementation. Results showed that all students exhibited at least 1 incidence of FF although no significant relationship was found between FF and their poor performance in solving the problems. The students explained that they got stuck in the known usage and it was difficult for them to think of other ways to use it in order to solve the problems.",SCOPUS_ID:85077688173,Investigating functional fixedness among novice student programmers,2-s2.0-85077688173,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721431'}]",,,96-98,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077688173,1,,cp,Conference Paper

Our goal was two-fold: (1) To determine the incidence and persistence of affective states exhibited by the students when working individually and in groups, and (2) to adapt the Baker Rodrigo Ocumpaugh Monitoring Protocol for collaborative learning situations. Our findings for this study are as follows: (1) in single-player mode, students exhibited greater engaged concentration, pride, and frustration and less excitement, delight, and confusion compared to the multiplayer mode; (2) that individual emotions can be distinct from group emotions; (3) that negative emotions like frustration and blame/guilt were only felt at the individual level and were not observed as shared by all the members of the group; (4) affective states tended to persist more within an individualized game setting compared to the collaborative game setting where there was a greater number of opportunities to experience a wider range of emotions, hence the low chance of persistence; (5) students within an individualized setting spent more time solving the game rounds, had fewer incorrect answers, even as they experienced more frustration, and finally, (6) students within a collaborative setting had fewer errors when they had a higher incidence of excitement and had more errors when they appeared to be concentrating due to the presence of the “gaming the system” behavior.",SCOPUS_ID:85077706530,An investigation of affect within Ibigkas!: An educational game for English,2-s2.0-85077706530,CHED,undefined,British Council,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-11-19,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789869721448'}]",,,539-547,"ICCE 2019 - 27th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077706530,2,,cp,Conference Paper
102421,Active queue management | Cloud computing | Congestion control | Data center networks | TCP incast,0,Alipio M.,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd In recent years, Data Centers Networks (DCNs) have been deployed to serve as the backbone to support the extensive variety of services offered through the Internet like social networking, web hosting, and e-commerce. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is at present, the most widely used transmission protocol in DCNs and the Internet. When several senders simultaneously send data to a single receiver in a DCN, congestion occurs at the switches' buffer at the receiver's end. This phenomenon of throughput collapse, particularly in data centers, is termed as the TCP incast problem. In this work, we survey and develop a classification scheme of TCP incast solutions in DCNs. We classify the TCP incast solutions on a multi-level criteria based on the TCP/IP protocol stack either TCP or non-TCP approach from our comprehensive survey. Each level includes sublevel classification such as delay-based congestion control schemes, active queue management based solutions, or probabilistic schemes. We also discuss the performance of each existing solutions in terms of its ability to alleviate the network during incast conditions. Furthermore, we present the strengths and weaknesses of each TCP incast techniques. Finally, we outline the open challenges and issues in mitigating the TCP incast in DCNs.

,Convergence | IRR | Newton-Raphson algorithm | Root-finding algorithm,0,Nagares N.,"© 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. The internal rate of return (IRR) is the most widely-used method in measuring the rate of return on investment (RROI), which helps investors decide whether an investment is viable or not. Iterative root-finding algorithms are the most efficient technique in calculating IRR, amongst which, the Newton-Raphson algorithm is the most popular and the fastest algorithm. However, when the primary unknown, which is provided by the user, is far from the actual root, the result of the algorithm, oftentimes, does not converge to the root. This problem is addressed by a midpoint-based Newton-Raphson algorithm. Nevertheless, said algorithm could further be improved in terms of proximity, speed, and accuracy. This study presents a novelty in estimating IRR using the centroid-based Newton-Raphson algorithm. The experimental results show that the presented algorithm is 32.76% faster than the midpoint approach.

In aerial images, human figures are often rendered at low resolution and in relatively small sizes compared to other objects in the scene, or resemble likelihood to other non-human objects. The localization of trust regions for possible containment of the human figure becomes difficult and computationally exhaustive. The objective of this work is to develop an anchorless region proposal which can emphasize potential persons from other objects and the vegetative background in aerial images. Samples are taken from different angles, altitudes and environmental factors such as illumination. The original image is rendered in rectified color space to create a pseudo-segmented version where objects of close chromaticity are combined. The geometric features of segments formed are then calculated and subjected to Radial-Greed Algorithm where segments resembling human figures are selected as the proposed regions for classification. The proposed method achieved 96.76% less computational cost against brute sliding window method and hit rate of 95.96%.

The proposed system utilized the image processing applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with mobile app as early notification to the end user. After executing 3999 iterations of 210 images are used for testing to get the Train Accuracy (how accurate the training is) and Cross entropy (how far is the prediction of the actual result), it resulted to 100% trained accuracy and 96% validation. The test evaluation accuracy result was 99% using a cached file of 210, it means that expect the model to perform ~99% accuracy on the new data. From the test that has been done, the proposed system was able to capture the fire flame images and send necessary notification real time. The test results show the captured actual images and the information sent to the end user. The summary test results verified that all gathered data was higher than 90% to be able to send notification.

99,ICTD | Repair | Rural Development | Technology for Development,0,Jang E.,"© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM. This paper analyzes the processes and challenges of technology repair in remote, low-income areas far from standard ICT repair infrastructure. Our sites of study are the fishing and farming villages of Dibut, Diotorin, and Dikapinisan in Aurora Province, Philippines, located in coastal coves against a mountain range. Residents are geographically isolated from urban areas, with the nearest peri-urban center of Baler a boat trip of several hours away, infeasible in some sea conditions. Unlike prior work in more connected rural areas, there are no local repair shops and device repair is uncommon, despite frequent breakage due to harsh conditions for electronics. The scarcity of local electronics repair limits technology access and leads to accumulation of e-waste. While prior work demonstrates that local electronics repair capability does arise in many rural areas around the world, we must also acknowledge that the successful emergence of this infrastructure depends on the intersection of many structural conditions and cannot be taken for granted. We present the material hardships of achieving local repair in terms of seams between heterogeneous urban and rural infrastructures, which illustrate the cove communities’ marginality with respect to many forms of public infrastructure. However, intermittent and informal repair infrastructures based on trust relationships emerge to patch these seams in remote settings. We show how trust affects the way people dynamically construct repair infrastructure and why, based on their remoteness and the resulting value propositions of repair. Networks of trust between repairers, their clients, suppliers, fellow repairers, and certifying or training institutions crucially facilitate the movement of resources and expertise across the Philippines, but also reinforce the marginality of residents and repairers in the coves. Despite these structural challenges, local people are able to maintain a robust ecosystem for rural electrical line repair, from which we generalize the model of training grounds as a strategy for sustaining local communities of repair experts.",SCOPUS_ID:85075043115,Trust and technology repair infrastructures in the remote rural Philippines: Navigating urban-rural seams,2-s2.0-85075043115,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-11-01,10.1145/3359201,,,CSCW,,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075043115,3,,ed,Editorial

,Image Steganography | Imperceptibility | RGB Image | Secret Key | Steganography with Encryption | Stego Image,0,Calanda F.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. While traditional embedding methods which are usually based on LSBs provide security to hidden messages in image-based Steganography, steganalyses have shown these methods to be vulnerable to detection and extraction, thus compromising the security of embedded messages. In this study, a new embedding method based on LSB is introduced to address this vulnerability. By using a one-time pad encryption method, the security of secret messages before embedding is ensured. A partitioning method based on columnar transposition and RGB color plane scattering technique is employed to improve scattering and ensure randomization during embedding. The experimental result shows an excellent outcome of the Peak-signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean square Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index. The PSNR value of the 5 test images results ranges from 53.2122 to 60.8716 all are higher than the acceptable value of PSNR, which is 30db.The average MSE result is0.2766 for all color planes, which also provide an outstanding result since the lower the MSE means the accumulative squared error between the stego image and the original one is lower. The average SSIM obtained in the testing is 0.9792for the 5 test images, which is very close to 1. The result supports the claim that the resulting stego images have low distortion which means that the cover image is almost the same with the stego image and that the modified LSB embedding algorithm provides excellent image quality with high imperceptibility and provides added security layers.",SCOPUS_ID:85077757596,A modified least significant bit randomized embedding method based on image partitioning and columnar transposition with encryption,2-s2.0-85077757596,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-18,10.1145/3366650.3366662,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450372909'}]",,,68-72,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077757596,,,cp,Conference Paper

Smoking is a widespread problem around the globe and having an algorithm that can automatically detect smoking events is crucial in helping to public areas free of dangerous cigarette smoke. This paper presents a method of detecting smoking events through multiple human tracking, action recognition and smoke detection. In the proposed method, human objects are first detected using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Then, the detected human objects are tracked using centroid tracking. The smoking event detection requires two factors. The first one is whether the detected human object is displaying actions that would suggest the act of smoking using CNN from Keras library and the other factor is whether there is cigarette smoke in the frame using SVM to identify the candidate areas and color features and pixel values as thresholds.

Partitioning methods is one of the most known and most used data clustering methods. The cluster center, known as centroid or medoid, represents each cluster that these methods produced. When the cluster center cannot describe all the data in the group, the undescribed data are mistakenly classified to their nearest cluster. These data are considered as local outliers. With this, the study seeks to address the problem of local outliers produced by partitioning methods specifically k-means and k-medoids.

We used the word embedding method to transform every word in the dataset and to obtain the custom-built word embedding vectors. This is in contrast to the approaches in the previous literature that implement word embedding using the pre-trained word embedding vectors. We enriched the custom-built word embedding vectors by incorporating Part-of-Speech (POS) tag vectors to provide additional semantic information about the word to be used in training our proposed classification model. The proposed model was built using the neural network approach, which is considered to be more efficient and reliable in solving real problems for document classification tasks. We fine-tuned the parameters during the training of our neural network classification model with our aim to increase the performance in terms of classification accuracy. The experimental result demonstrates that our model performs remarkably well and increase the percentage accuracy up to 1.7% compared to the accuracy results obtained by the previous baseline word embedding methods using the same dataset.

,Feature selection | Filter methods | Machine learning | Multiclass | Text classification,0,Cascaro R.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Feature selection is used in choosing relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of a machine learning model. Irrelevant features tend to decrease model accuracy and cause overfitting. Feature selection is the solution to dimensionality problems, especially that data nowadays are unstructured. There are three types of feature selection techniques; filter, wrapper and embedded. Filter methods uses statistical scoring and ranks features by the score. Wrapper methods uses a model to select features and evaluates according to model accuracy. Embedded methods combine the properties of both previous algorithms and selects features in the process of training. This study is focused on the filter types, specifically Chi-square, Information Gain and Relief. On the other hand, multiclass classification is a task that involves classifying instances into three or more classes. This paper aims to compare the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) multiclass classifier when entered with feature subsets generated from three different filter feature selection methods. The dataset is a clothing review text data taken from Kaggle. It contains multiple classes with 23486 review instances. Since filter selection methods utilize ranking, CHI, IG, and Relief were able to select and rank almost the same number of features. When the data was fed into SVM, CHI garnered 66.84% accuracy, IG got 32.90% accuracy while Relief obtained 29.69% accuracy. Experiments on SVM showed that among the generated data subset from the three filter selection methods, the subset using CHI yielded higher accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score compared to others.",SCOPUS_ID:85077734253,Filter selection methods for multiclass classification,2-s2.0-85077734253,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-18,10.1145/3366650.3366655,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450372909'}]",,,27-31,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077734253,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Affinity propagation | Clustering | Imbalanced dataset | SMOTE,0,Laureano L.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Imbalanced datasets occur in real-world scenarios and affect the performance of the classifiers in supervised learning. To combat the imbalance between majority and minority instances, several techniques including SMOTE which generates artificial data along the line between minority samples and its selected neighbors are used in preprocessing. However, SMOTE suffers from generating synthetic data in noise regions and imbalanced distribution of samples within the minority class. Using clustering techniques prior to the oversampling step to determine the target areas of the input space where the generation of synthetic samples is effective, is known to be an extension of SMOTE. The proposed method uses affinity propagation as a clustering technique to generate clusters and its cluster exemplar without requiring the specification of the number of clusters a priori. The cluster exemplar becomes the basis of which samples are to be oversampled in each cluster.

The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is one of an encryption algorithm that uses a cyclic process in producing sub keys from secret key using its key schedule but generates large weak keys. GISKOP is a modified IDEA that uses the concept of serpent key scheduling operation to address the weak keys found on the original IDEA. Randomness test was used to identify the dependence and correlations between generated sub-keys of a key scheduling operation. Statistical evaluation was done to analyze and compare key distribution and exchange operations of the modified key scheduling operation. The GISKOP key scheduling operation obtained an increase of 8% randomness using frequency test in the sub-key independence level. Also, it was able to maintain its 100% randomness under the sub-key level independence. Thus, proving that each generated sub keys are not correlated with each other. With this, many attacks on systems that implement IDEA can be mitigated.

,Image processing | Random forest | Rice disease detection | Support vector machine,0,Pascual E.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. In the Philippines, rice is one of the most important food consumed for almost every meal and so, it is essential to meet the demands in rice production. However, local storms contribute to the susceptibility of rice plants to diseases debilitating the ability of farms to produce large amount of high-quality rice. Identification of diseases are done manually by farmers based on experience or an expert’s advice. This paper proposes an automated detection of diseases using image processing. In the segmentation technique, the images are divided into two sets where green pixels are masked with 1) blue and 2) black pixels, along with the other features, and are then fed separately into SVM and Random Forest to compare their performance. Results show that blue pixels and SVM as its classifier have yielded better outcome having 82.41% as compared to the other model.",SCOPUS_ID:85077735299,Disease detection of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) in the Philippines using image processing,2-s2.0-85077735299,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-18,10.1145/3366650.3366676,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450372909'}]",,,131-135,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077735299,,,cp,Conference Paper

This study focuses on the application of Deep Neural Networks trained to discriminate amongst senones to improve speaker recognition performance when dealing with text-independent Short Utterance Speaker Recognition (SUSR). The features derived from the said network are theorized to be more robust given that they can eliminate any unnecessary information in the final representation of the speaker. The efficacy of these features is evaluated using the test subset of the LibriSpeech speech corpus.

,Influenza A | MUSCLE | Phylogenetic analysis | Vaccine | Whole genome sequence alignment,0,Gomez M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Influenza A is a rapidly mutating virus that can be easily transmitted in both humans and animals. Influenza A is divided into subtypes based on two glycoproteins in the virus: the hemagluttinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). The virus has been the cause of many epidemics and pandemics throughout history and thus, the utilization of vaccines against the virus is paramount. The study used the program MUSCLE to determine the evolution and mutation of influenza A pathogens. Through this, it was found that the eight segments that make up the influenza A pathogens produced different levels of mutations with some segments being highly conserved and others undergoing major changes. The highly conserved regions in segments 2 and 3 are good targets in developing new vaccines. Genes encoding ofr surface proteins were highly mutated across the strains and prompts vaccine developers to continually update their viral epitope targets. Further studies are encouraged to identify all genes in the highly conserved regions in the hopes of finding a gene product on the surface of the virus that can be locked on to as an epitope target of vaccine development.",SCOPUS_ID:85077744746,Whole genome sequence analysis of influenza A virus from four outbreaks between 1968-2013,2-s2.0-85077744746,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-17,10.1145/3365966.3365981,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450376815'}]",,,65-68,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077744746,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Alpha-conotoxin | Conopeptides | Conotoxins | FATCAT | Protein structure | Structural alignment,0,Gomez M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Conopeptides are small, disulfide-rich polypeptides that have great potential as sources of possible drug candidates due to their activity against membrane receptors and ion channels. A challenge to the faster high-throughput in silico screening of these potential drug candidates is their diversity in structure and relatively low sequence similarity despite similar functions. In this study, the conopeptides of the α-pharmacological family is studied based on their Cα backbone, surface topology and sequence analysis. Structural alignment using FATCAT shows good alignment of the conopeptides based on their RMSD values. The main factor contributing to the homology of their structures is not only the Cys (Cys) framework forming the disulfide bridges but also the number of intervening amino acids between the Cys residues and the length of the polypeptide. The topological landscape of the conopeptides were influenced by the Cα backbone and the nature of the intervening amino acid, and are predominantly electron-poor regions, allowing them to act as Lewis acids. This may play a role in their ability to interact with ACh receptors.",SCOPUS_ID:85077753063,Alpha-family of conotoxins: An analysis of structural determinants,2-s2.0-85077753063,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-17,10.1145/3365966.3365977,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450376815'}]",,,40-46,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077753063,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Conopeptides | Conotoxins | FATCAT | Omega-conotoxin | POSA | Protein structure | Structural alignment,0,Gomez M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Conopeptides are small disulfide-rich peptides isolated from the venom of marine cone snails, and they are amongst the most interesting of the venom species. In this paper, in silico structural models and alignments of ω-conotoxin and different pharmacological family with the same cysteine framework (VI/VII) will be discussed using computational methods – FATCAT and POSA. The results show that with the ω-CTX conopeptide aligned with ω-CTX conopeptide, it would most likely have significantly similar structures with lower RMSD as they both function as blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels, and this conopeptide would be ω-CTX MVIIA 1OMGA aligned with ω-CTX MVIIA 1TTK. On the other hand, having compared different pharmacological with ω-CTX would result to a fewer significantly similar results since their amino acid residues, and ion channels are quite different. Multiple alignment of structures across different pharmacological families show similarities in their polypeptide backbone.

Modern genomic breeding methods rely heavily on very large amounts of phenotyping and genotyping data, presenting new challenges in effective data management and integration. Recently, the size and complexity of datasets have increased significantly, with the result that data are often stored on multiple systems. As analyses of interest increasingly require aggregation of datasets from diverse sources, data exchange between disparate systems becomes a challenge. Results: To facilitate interoperability among breeding applications, we present the public plant Breeding Application Programming Interface (BrAPI). BrAPI is a standardized web service API specification. The development of BrAPI is a collaborative, community-based initiative involving a growing global community of over a hundred participants representing several dozen institutions and companies. Development of such a standard is recognized as critical to a number of important large breeding system initiatives as a foundational technology. The focus of the first version of the API is on providing services for connecting systems and retrieving basic breeding data including germplasm, study, observation, and marker data. A number of BrAPI-enabled applications, termed BrAPPs, have been written, that take advantage of the emerging support of BrAPI by many databases.

,complex system modeling | dynamic inoperability input–output model | inventory | supply chain resilience | systemic risk,0,Jabilles E.,"© 2019, © 2019 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management. The interdependent nature of highly interconnected systems, such as supply chains, renders them incapable of quickly resuming operation following a disruptive event. In the context of supply chains, previous works have demonstrated the efficacy of inventory as a mitigation strategy to delay the impact of disruptive events. However, current methods tend to focus only on a demand-driven approach, which may be inappropriate for some systems where a value-added price perturbation represents an impact. Thus, this paper offers a methodology for understanding the role of inventory in the supply-side dynamic inoperability input–output model (DIIM). To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, an illustrative example is presented using data from the 2012 Philippines Input–Output (I-O) Table in five different scenarios. Given a predefined planning horizon, the results of this work can serve as guidelines for decision-makers for the provision of inventory that will keep the overall inoperability of an entire supply chain at a minimum.",SCOPUS_ID:85062348395,Simulating the impact of inventory on supply chain resilience with an algorithmic process based on the supply-side dynamic inoperability input–output model,2-s2.0-85062348395,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-10-02,10.1080/17509653.2018.1555693,,17509653,4,253-263,International Journal of Management Science and Engineering Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062348395,14,,ar,Article

In this study, the potential bioactivities of Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata) proteins were predicted through in silico analyses and confirmed by in vitro tests. C. angulata proteins were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and identified by proteomics techniques. Hydrolysis simulation by BIOPEP-UWM database revealed that pepsin (pH > 2) can theoretically release greatest amount of bioactive peptides from C. angulata proteins, predominantly angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides, followed by stem bromelain and papain. Hydrolysates produced by pepsin, bromelain and papain have shown ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities in vitro, with pepsin hydrolysate (PEH) having the strongest activity of 78.18% and 44.34% at 2 mg/mL, respectively. Bioactivity assays of PEH fractions showed that low molecular weight (MW) fractions possessed stronger inhibitory activity than crude hydrolysate. Overall, in vitro analysis results corresponded with in silico predictions. Current findings suggest that in silico analysis is a rapid method to predict bioactive peptides in food proteins and determine suitable enzymes for hydrolysis.

Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN) or Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a growing field in healthcare applications. It enables remote monitoring of patient’s physiological data through wireless communication. It is composed of sensor network which collects physiological data from the patient. There are several issues concerning WBAN such as security, power, routing protocol to address QoS metrics (reliability, end-to-end delay, and energy efficiency), etc. The focus of the study is the issue on different QoS metrics. There were several QoS aware routing protocol that has been proposed which implements multiple queues for different types of data. However, one issue on multiple queue system is starvation, end-to-end delay, and reliability. The study proposed an efficient priority queue-based data transmission that improves the end-to-end delay, reliability, and queuing delay of QoS aware routing protocol.

With the recent advancements in ultra-low power wireless devices such as wireless sensor networks, the demand for nanowatt voltage references capable of operating below 1-V becomes a necessity. But due to the low voltage overhead imposed by the supply, most of the recent literatures on sub-1-V voltage references exhibited low power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and thus were prone to switching noise induced at the supply line. This paper presents a high PSRR, subthreshold MOSFET-only voltage reference which has been simulated in 0.18\ \mu\mathrm{m} TSMC CMOS process using the Synopsys HSPICE tool. The circuit employed a PSRR enhancement block that suppresses the variation along the supply of the core voltage reference. This circuit block implemented a negative feedback network that regulated the internal supply voltage of the core reference circuit. Simulation results showed that the proposed overall circuit generated an output voltage of 244.5 mV which operated properly at a supply voltage of 0.95-V and achieved a PSRR of -140.6 dB, -101.1 dB, - 64.3 dB, and -38.4 dB at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 10 MHz respectively.

In agriculture sector, forecasting yields such as in banana harvest is essential for extensive planning for a sustainable production. However, studies have shown that agricultural problems like forecasting yields remain difficult due to the lack of the necessary and optimal infrastructures. Recently, deep-learning (DL) approach like the recurrent neural network-long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) has been used as a new alternative model in time series (TS) forecasting. In this paper, using the banana harvest data from agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) cooperative in Davao del Norte, Philippines, proved that RNN-LSTM has the capability in forecasting harvest yields over conventional-based model like the famous autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Using the same set of training and testing data, experiment exhibits that RNN-LSTM obtains 43.69 in terms of root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and ARIMA obtains 64.11respectively. This means that RNN-LSTM outperforms the ARIMA model with 32.31 percent reduction in error rates. Since there is no proof that RNN-LSTM has been used with the same agricultural problem domain, therefore, there is no standard available with regards to the level of error reduction in the forecast. Moreover, as enhancement to the performance of the model, the use of multiple LSTM layers joined together and the use of regularization technique like dropout are suggested for exploration. Furthermore, extending and embedding this approach to a web-based application is the future plan for the benefit of the medium scale banana growers of the region for efficient and effective decision making and advance planning.",SCOPUS_ID:85076437341,Forecasting banana harvest yields using deep learning,2-s2.0-85076437341,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-01,10.1109/ICSEngT.2019.8906427,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728107585'}]",,,380-384,"2019 IEEE 9th International Conference on System Engineering and Technology, ICSET 2019 - Proceeding",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076437341,,,cp,Conference Paper

Classification is one of the primary data science tasks involving large datasets. To date, fish species classification in the Philippines is considered significant for further aquaculture and protection. However, immense efforts and knowledge are necessary to determine fish characteristics through classification. The VGG16 network is one of the top pre-trained models but is still not able to accurately classify common fish species found in Verde Island. This study primarily aims to classify Verde Island fish species using a modified VGG16 network. The VGG16 Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) undergoes retraining, fine-tuning, and optimization to provide better accuracies in classifying specific Verde Island fish species. Also, this research generated augmented synthetic data for training and testing the model, as there are limited images available. Augmented images are flipped, rotated, cropped, zoomed, and sheared to provide a robust number of features for classification.

Ensemble learning methods as compared to a conventional machine learning method can enhance the classification performance of a network intrusion detection system. The main idea of such methods is to emulate the human nature of gathering and weighing various viewpoints and combining them before making an important decision. However, in selecting the best ensemble learning method, proper assessment is imperative. Hence, this paper provides a comparative study of different ensemble learning methods such as Adaptive Boost, Gradient Boost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Logistic Regression based on classification performance and computational cost. The NSL-KDD dataset is selected for this research and is pre-processed to train and test the methods in classifying network intrusions. A comparative analysis of each method is evaluated using the performance metrics, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and computational cost based on training and classification speed.

Improper solid waste management poses a major concern not only in the Philippines but also on a global scale. Metro Manila has more serious concerns in waste management than in other urban areas in the Philippines affecting nearly twelve (12) million of its people. In response to the efforts initiated by the Philippine government to help reduce solid waste problems, the Local Government Units (LGUs) have recognized the role of junk shops in promoting proper waste management. The community, on the other hand, is encouraged to collect recyclable materials to be sold to junkshop owners and scrap buyers. This collect-sell method to the community has been referred to as 'may pera sa basura' or there is money in waste to promote proper waste management. This study promotes proper solid waste management in the barangay level by presenting a mobile application framework dubbed as Perazuhan, a contraction between Pera (Money) and Basura (Trash or waste) which signifies that you can get money out of the selling solid wastes. This technologically driven approach provides a manageable and accessible selling of recyclable materials like bottles, newspapers, papers, and plastics to junk shops. To regulate the collection and selling of recyclable materials, the barangay officials will serve as an intermediary between the junk shops and community to develop full inclusive waste management.",SCOPUS_ID:85075632139,Perazuhan: A Mobile Application for Solid Waste Micro-Management Framework,2-s2.0-85075632139,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-01,10.1109/SCORED.2019.8896301,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728126135'}]",,,17-20,"2019 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development, SCOReD 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075632139,,,cp,Conference Paper

Based on a survey, with the world’s population growing every year, the supply of usable water is not keeping enough with the required amount of water needed for survival. Nowadays, clean water has become a business which produces constraints when it comes to accessibility. Here in the Philippines, there are various diseases every year which relates to unsafe drinking water which may sometimes lead to death. The researchers want to know the effectivity of the assessed solar desalination system, how much desalinated water could this system provide and how long does it take for this amount to be produced in a given day. This study uses a parabolic trough which is the main means of harnessing solar energy and transferring this energy to the saltwater container which will heat up the pre-specified amount of saline water. The vapor will evaporate and the condensate will be trapped in the glass lid and routed to a desalinated water container. An evaluation is made to know the effective glass thickness for the device, the 3mm, 6mm and 10 mm thickness has been assessed and after the testing phase, it has been found out that the 10 mm glass thickness produced the optimum results. It is able to produce a liter of desalinated water out of 5000 mL of saline water.

This study deals with the development of a polyethylene terephthalate or PET plastic shredder for Xavier University in order to reduce the transportation cost of used plastic bottles to the designated dump site some 9 kilometers uphill. The development of this 2 horsepower plastic shredder is also useful for the reduction of the volume of plastic materials in the Material Recovery Facility of the municipality of Alubijid, Misamis Oriental. Xavier University has a collection of used plastic bottles of around 365 kg per month with an aggregate volume of 17.42 m3 and until the next garbage collection services arrive, the amount of plastic waste will occupy a considerable volume or space. This study focuses on the development and testing of the capacity of the developed plastic shredder. This study is inspired by the project of Mr. Dave Hakkens, called Precious Plastic, that aims to fight plastic pollution by developing machines that aid in recycling all sorts of plastic materials. The objective of this study is to analyze the cost of developing these machines in the Xavier University setting, their cost of operation, and effectiveness through minimizing the volume of plastic bottle. In this study, only polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic are being used. By consultation of local manufacturing firms in developing the machines through their specialized equipment, the authors have found that cost of development is high. However, a compromise between quality and precision has been decided to reduce the overall cost of the development of the machine. The authors were able to develop the proposed machines through the application of skills in machine workshop practices in the mechanical engineering laboratory. The XU plastic shredder has an average plastic volume reduction of 82.41%.

Distance estimation and localization based on Received Signal Strength Indicator is the most popular approach used in wireless sensor networks because of its simplicity and low-cost implementation. A complementing system to WSN is the radio-frequency identification system which also uses RSSI. In this paper, the principle of localization technique is evaluated in an RFID system using a design of experiment. In a virtual environment setup, ranging test and localization test is done by using tag properties and RSSI readings to determine the location of the tag and the corresponding distance error. The use of an active RFID system emulated environment with readers and tags deployed in a 2D space proved that RSSI based distance estimation is linear in short range and unstable in long range with distance variance of 1.33m. It is also demonstrated that additional RFID readers used as reference for distance estimation give smaller localization error of 0.43m than using only one reader with an error of 1.07m. The experiment shows how RSSI can be unreliable in distance estimation, hence, elevates the need for more accurate localization algorithms.",SCOPUS_ID:85077964263,RSSI-based Localization in an Emulated Active RFID System,2-s2.0-85077964263,DOST,undefined,"Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines",0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-01,10.1109/IEMCON.2019.8936285,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728125305'}]",,,771-778,"2019 IEEE 10th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference, IEMCON 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077964263,,,cp,Conference Paper

We explore the problem of finding semantically relevant court rulings from a current legal case by proposing a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and Doc2Vec models for multi-class multi-label text classification. Specifically, the problem we aim to solve is: given a case and its statement of facts, what are the other cases that are closely related to it and may be used as resources to build arguments for the given case? The dataset was scraped and extracted from the LawPhil Project of the Arellano Law Foundation. To extract the suitable features for the models, inputs are first cleaned, tokenized and transformed into its dense vector representation. Thus, a Word2Vec model is first trained on the corpus of case laws between 1987-2013 for feature extraction. We used two configurations for our output space: predicting the cases taken from a pool of the top 500 and top 100 most cited cases. Our results show that it is challenging to obtain a good balance between precision and recall. Some model configurations achieve good recall at the expense of precision and vice versa. In addition to CNN and LSTM, we also explored a Doc2Vec model based on trained to find the cases that are most similar semantically to a particular case. Sensitivity analysis is performed regarding the number of recommended similar cases outputted by the Doc2Vec model its effect on recall. Finally, we also explore a problem that is a bit simpler than our primary objective in this paper: predicting the laws associated to a given case.

8929332,adulterated pork meat | classifier | logistic regression | machine learning | sensors,0,Monsura A.,"© 2019 IEEE. Pork in the Philippines is mostly sourced locally, and not all these meats come from well-sanitized slaughterhouses. Some carcasses of pigs that have died other than by slaughtering, called adulterated or double-dead meat, make their way to markets and get mixed up with legal and safe meat, only to be sold to unsuspecting consumers. These pose health hazards to meat handlers and consumers. One of the longtime practices in preventing the proliferation of double-dead meat in the markets is the manual inspection that analyzes the meat based on its organoleptic properties. This solution, however, is prone to limitations of subjectivity and human evaluation error. In this study, the proponents designed a system that will identify whether the meat sample is adulterated or not. The system is aimed at providing fast and accurate detection of double-dead meat using color and chemical determinants that is at least comparable to, or better than, humans. The application of the system can be utilized to replace the traditional human evaluation using electronic sensors as to avoid bias in the evaluation of the meat by different assessors as well as to eliminate the health risks on the meat inspectors and the consumers. The system utilizes three sensors: color sensor, methane sensor and pH level sensor. A microcontroller implements a logistic regression classifier. The model performs well, with an accuracy of 91.40% after validation, with an area of 0.95 under its ROC. When realized, the model has an accuracy of 93.18% compared to 84.09% of the human assessor's evaluation of the same meat samples.",SCOPUS_ID:85077688392,Detection of Adulterated Pork Meat via Color and Chemical Characteristics,2-s2.0-85077688392,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-01,10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929332,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728118956'}]",21593442,,2099-2104,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077688392,2019-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Bridging the communication gap between speech-impaired individuals who are also physically-disabled is essential to maintain their social integration in the society. With this, a speech-assistive device integrated in an Android mobile application was developed. An integrated sensor box was designed to interface five sensors capable of detecting physical movements. These movements are then translated into digitals signals and transmitted to the developed Android mobile application using Bluetooth communication. This allows the user to communicate through the features of the mobile application such as text-to-speech and pictograms using a single-input interface. From here, a case study was conducted on two individuals who both suffered from stroke, inhibiting their speech and physical movements. Their limited but controllable movements such as blinking, and finger gestures were detected. The results also showed the limitation of the system as it requires practice to effectively use the system. As such, the developed speech-assistive system can be a potential form of physical and mental rehabilitation as a learning curve can be developed when using the mobile application.

The simultaneous quantitative determination of multiple ions in complex media can be achieved with the use of potentiometric sensor arrays, or 'electronic tongues.' Potentiometric sensor arrays are composed of multiple cross-sensitive sensors whose responses are analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods to extract the desired quantitative information. One of the most important considerations for designing an array for a given analytical task is the array configuration, or the number and types of sensors incorporated into the array. However, there are currently no theoretical approaches for the a priori design of a potentiometric sensor array, so arrays are currently designed via experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we propose the application of an information theoretic approach as a means to theoretically evaluate the analytical capability of a potentiometric sensor array configuration for a given analytical task. Using a Fisher Information criterion derived for potentiometric sensors, we explored potentiometric sensor array designs with simulated potentiometric sensors, and compared these designs with conventional, empirically-based designs from the literature. Finally, we compute the theoretical performances of various sensor array configurations using the Fisher Information criterion and compare our predictions to the experimental performances from the literature. Our results suggest that Fisher Information can be applied as a theoretical metric to screen for promising array configurations prior to experimental trial-and-error.",SCOPUS_ID:85076424154,Information theoretic analysis of potentiometric sensor array configurations,2-s2.0-85076424154,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-10-01,10.1109/ICSEngT.2019.8906332,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728107585'}]",,,465-470,"2019 IEEE 9th International Conference on System Engineering and Technology, ICSET 2019 - Proceeding",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076424154,,,cp,Conference Paper

Game-Based Learning (GBL) is considered as an effective tool to motivate and engage students to learn. The literature indicates that Game-based learning using video games has allowed game developers to apply Bloom's Taxonomy of learning. Although there are several video games available on the Internet as examples of GBL, very little seem to present the use of avatar customization as a key feature. Avatar or character customization is a ubiquitous feature found on video games which allow users to create their own experiences over the game. Literature indicates that autonomy, a product of character customization, leads to game enjoyment and game loyalty. When users experience enjoyment in the game, they are likely to achieve better. This paper adds novelty to the body of knowledge in game-based learning by designing a mobile game application dubbed as 'ALGEbright' that incorporates the use of avatar customization for the Algebra subject in secondary education. The ALGEBright is designed to provide an easy to understand and friendly user interface intended for beginners. Users can access the mobile app anytime and anywhere at their own convenience, a key feature of Mobile Learning. What makes the mobile app unique is aside from the character customization, the teacher or instructor module is incorporated in the application.

Monitoring and Refilling System is a system for monitoring I.V. therapy and notifying abnormal drip rate and refilling of the I.V. bag. The system has a portable receiver device (for the nurse/nurse station) and a transmitter device (for the patient). The study uses Radio Frequency (RF) medium. RF module was used for transmitting and receiving of the current status data of the monitoring and notifying system. The system has also fiber optic sensors for detecting and counting the drip rate of the I.V. bag. The control panel of the system is placed on the transmitter (patient side). The main objective of the monitoring system is to process an accurate I.V. therapy, prevent the possible backflow of the blood by stopping the I.V. set attached to the system. It makes the I.V. therapy setup fast and easy allowing more time for nurses to perform duties other than monitoring the IV therapy of patients assigned to them. System test results show that transmission delay is not evident in closed area and can transmit accurately without delay up to 70 meters. A 100% detection rates were also recorded for different drip rates and percent IV bag content. Comparing the operating frequency of the I.V. monitoring and refilling system to other medical equipment, the RF module used in the system has an operating frequency that is unique among all the technologies and equipment that may be present in a hospital or clinical setting.

However, these fish condo consumes local grid power and Dr. Westly Rosario of NIFTDC BFAR Daugupan aimed to help these farmers even without local grid supply. A design of solar powered aquarium was developed to respond to this need. The design system uses solar panel as its source. Computations show that a 400-watt solar panel can supply the system load including the motor pump. Charging and discharging time of the battery were also determined. Maximum panel output was also suggested following the optimum tilt per month. An automatic water filtering system was also included that measures both dissolved oxygen and pH level of the water inside the culture chambers. Nominal values of pH and dissolved oxygen were set to automatically normalize these values according to the appropriate aquatic living conditions of African catfish.

,Cooperative learning | Education | Structured grouping scheme | Unstructured grouping scheme,0,Columbano M.,"© BEIESP. Cooperative learning is an educational approach which aims to organize classroom activities into academic and social learning experiences (Gillies, 2016). There is much more to cooperative learning than merely arranging students into groups, and it has been described as ""structuring positive interdependence. Students must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another's resources and skills, asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, and monitoring one another's work, (Chiu, 2008). This study aims to find out how cooperative learning through structured and unstructured grouping schemes compare in terms of their effectiveness in reinforcing students’ Mathematics achievement and the difficulties encountered by the students in both structured and unstructured groups. The one-shot quasi-experimental research design specifically the pre-posttest design was employed in the study. Participants of this study were the first year students of the College of Teacher Education of Cagayan State University. Descriptive and inferential statistics like frequency count, percentage, mean and t-test for dependent and independent samples were used to interpret the data. The integration of cooperative learning strategy, either structured or unstructured grouping schemes reinforce the performance of students in Mathematics. However, cooperative learning has far better results when unstructured grouping scheme is employed among students. Since the students find difficulty on simplifying expressions with rational exponents to radicals, composition of functions, solving linear and quadratic equations and solving word problems on linear and quadratic equations; intervention measures such as modular approach in teaching, simulation activities and remedial teaching were suggested to address such difficulties and to enhance the performance of the students in Mathematics particularly in College Algebra.",SCOPUS_ID:85073808933,Reinforcing students’ mathematical skills through cooperative learning strategy,2-s2.0-85073808933,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-10-01,10.35940/ijitee.L2683.1081219,,,12,3774-3781,International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073808933,8,,ar,Article

,Fourier transform algorithmics | Parallel algorithms | Short time Fourier transform | Signal processing,0,Labao A.,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc. In this paper, we present the staggered parallel short-time Fourier transform, an algorithm that uses a quasi-parallel procedure to compute exact STFT coefficients of 1D signals. The algorithm leverages parallelism with the capacity of feedforward STFT algorithms to re-use prior computations. It performs this by carefully organizing input signals and collecting past computations into 2D memory buffers. Re-using stored information in memory enables fast computation of up to N/2 FFTs in parallel. The algorithm's time complexity is at O[6T] under an abstract circuit implementation – achieving a complexity measure that is independent of sample complexity N. Its time complexity is asymptotically equivalent with the best possible exact algorithm of O[T] time complexity, with a constant efficiency at O[1] relative to the best known sequential algorithm. Its efficiency property holds whether in an abstract circuit implementation or in a CPU implementation with limited number of cores. In general, the algorithm consumes less processors than other parallel STFT algorithms but can potentially require more memory. To test the algorithm's properties, we implement several STFT algorithms in a CPU with varying numbers of cores. These algorithms use either FFT, iterative, or feedforward schemes to capture the range of existing STFT algorithms for comparison. From our experimental results, our proposed algorithm has the least running time among exact STFT algorithms, while consuming less CPU processors than other forms of parallel implementations.",SCOPUS_ID:85069839513,Staggered parallel short-time Fourier transform,2-s2.0-85069839513,DOST,undefined,Department of Science and Technology,0,False,S105120041930096X,Journal,2019-10-01,10.1016/j.dsp.2019.07.003,,10512004,,70-86,Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069839513,93,,ar,Article

8929426,Mask R-CNN | time interval image capture | traffic monitoring | vehicle counting system,0,Piedad E.,"© 2019 IEEE. Traffic congestion is an undesirable problem for big cities especially in third world countries. Better policy planning and decision-making from the authority comes from well-conducted practical research. In this study, a Vehicle Count System (VCS) using deep learning Mask R-CNN is developed to classify and count vehicles passing in a target street. A novel time interval image capture (TIIC) system is employed to the VCS instead of the typical real-time video streaming to avoid big data storage cost. To determine the effectiveness of the developed VCS, its output is compared to that of conventional method from manual recording of the passing vehicles. Four vehicle types - cars, motorbikes, trucks and buses are present in the 1800 real traffic images gathered from an actual field. As an initial stage, the developed tool performs satisfactorily in classifying and counting car-type vehicle with 97.62% accuracy in a 10-hour testing.

,Automated essay scoring | Bloom’s taxonomy | Gradient boosting regression | Gradient boosting regression | Linear lassor regression | Linear regression | Ridge regression,0,Contreras J.,"© BEIESP. Essay writing examination is commonly used learning activity in all levels of education and disciplines. It is advantageous in evaluating the student’s learning outcomes because it gives them the chance to exhibit their knowledge and skills freely. For these reasons, a lot of researchers turned their interest in Automated essay scoring (AES) is one of the most remarkable innovations in text mining using Natural Language Processing and Machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated essay scoring that uses ontology and Natural Language Processing. Different learning algorithms showed agreeing prediction outcomes but still regression algorithm with the proper features incorporated with it may produce more accurate essay score. This study aims to increase the accuracy, reliability and validity of the AES by implementing the Gradient ridge regression with the domain ontology and other features. Linear regression, linear lasso regression and ridge regression were also used in conjunction with the different features that was extracted. The different features extracted are the domain concepts, average word length, orthography (spelling mistakes), grammar and sentiment score. The first dataset used is the ASAP dataset from Kaggle website is used to train and test different machine learning algorithms that is consist of linear regression, linear lasso regression, ridge regression and gradient boosting regression together with the different features identified. The second dataset used is the one extracted from the student’s essay exam in Human Computer Interaction course. The results show that the Gradient Boosting Regression has the highest variance and kappa scores. However, we can tell that there are similarities when it comes to performances for Linear, Ridge and Lasso regressions due to the dataset used which is ASAP. Furthermore, the results were evaluated using Cohen Weighted Kappa (CWA) score and compared the agreement between the human raters. The CWA result is 0.659 that can be interpreted as Strong level of agreement between the Human Grader and the automated essay score.

,Matrix representation | Membrane computing | NP-Complete | Rules on synapse | Spiking neural P systems,2,Cabarle F.,"© 2019 Spiking neural P systems, or SN P systems, are parallel and nondeterministic computing models inspired by spike processing of neurons. A variant of SN P systems known as SN P systems with rules on synapses, or RSSN P systems, makes use of the neuroscience idea where synapses or links between neurons perform spike processing instead of neurons. The spike processing in synapses instead of in neurons can allow RSSN P systems to have a smaller complexity due to their richer semantics, as compared to SN P systems. In this work we are first to provide the following: definitions of complexity classes of problems solved by RSSN P systems, depending if the problem has a uniform or nonuniform type of solution; both types of solutions to the NP-complete problem Subset sum; matrix representation and simulation algorithm for RSSN P systems. Such representation and algorithm can aid in practical use of RSSN P systems. We also provide small computer simulations based on our representation and algorithm. Our simulations show that the nonuniform and uniform solutions to Subset sum are better suited in the sequential CPU and the parallel GPU computer, respectively.

,Car Pheromone Capacity | Road Pheromone Availability | Road Pheromone Capacity | Road Pheromone Speed Limit | Traffic Light Pheromone Delay,0,Jayoma J.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Inverse Ant Algorithm is an enhanced Ant Algorithm that covers real-world scenarios to avoid stagnation in finding the best path from the source to destination. This is done by incorporating rules and constraints that contributes to pheromone level concentration in the path which is the basis for its decision making on agent’s choice of next move. Other modifications like path elimination rule was added to ensure that only short paths were eligible of the selection process of ants’ next move as it traverses from the source to its destination. Through the path elimination rule modification the inverse ant algorithm was able to eliminate long distant paths as ants’ choice for the next possible move and eventually return choices of shorter paths for the ants’ selection process which the inverse ant algorithm with path elimination rule has successfully implemented which resulted to shorter best path and it avoid stagnation as rules and constraints are applied. However, even with its increase in efficiency, the current implementations uses the same pheromone concentration on the path as its initial value and agents deposit the same pheromone cost as agents traverse the path. In addition, the current implement uses the same pheromone evaporation cost overtime in each path which is not the actual defection in the real-world. In order to address this issue a modification is introduced to the current Inverse Ant Algorithm model which uses variable path rules and constraints that mimics real world scenarios in a road traffic network such as car length rules, traffic light delay rule, path speed limit rule, and path pheromone capacity rule. The enhancements made is applied to the current implementation in order to achieve reliability in implementing route optimization and to enhance its performance.",SCOPUS_ID:85076772617,Enhanced inverse ant algorithm with mutable path pheromone concentration,2-s2.0-85076772617,CSU,undefined,California State University,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-09-20,10.1145/3361821.3361834,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450372411'}]",,,97-101,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076772617,,,cp,Conference Paper
,CO2 emissions | Diesel engine | Jatropha seed cake | Optimization | Producer gas | Response surface methodology,0,Rith M.,"© 2019, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved. Jatropha seed cake is a byproduct of biodiesel production, and the seed cake can be used as a feedstock for a gasifier. The gasified seed cake can partially reduce fossil diesel consumption to run a diesel engine. However, an increase in gas flow rate is associated with a higher diesel substitution rate, but a higher specific CO2 emission is observed. This study attempts to optimize diesel injection timing (DIT), gaseous fuel flow rate, and engine load to offset the specific diesel consumption and the specific CO2 emissions at a high engine speed of 3,000 rpm. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to statistically develop mathematical models of the response variables as functions of the design variables. A desirability function was then applied to maximize overall desirability. It highlighted that an overall desirability of 0.829 was obtained at 11° before top dead center (BTDC) of the DIT, a 10 kg/h gas flow rate, and 70% of the full engine load. At the optimum operating settings, the specific diesel consumption (SDC) and the specific CO2 emission were 0.0967 kg/kWh and 0.6123 kg/kWh, respectively. A value of electrical-thermal efficiency was found to be 14.10%.

,Accessibility | CO  emission 2 | Household vehicle ownership | Metro Manila | Multinomial logit model | Public transport,0,Rith M.,"© 2019, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved. Projected economic growth is expected to further increase vehicle ownership among households in Metropolitan Manila. This increase is likely to translate to higher energy requirements, elevated greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as a worsening of traffic congestion. A multinomial logit-based household vehicle ownership model was developed taking into account household characteristics and urban form peculiarities that are hypothesized to affect the level of vehicle ownership among households. The model utilized data gathered from a survey of 2,300 households from various areas of Metropolitan Manila. Results indicated that flooding susceptibility of communities does not affect vehicle ownership and type among its residents. Higher public transport density and closer proximity to essential facilities and services were found to be strong determinants that discourage vehicle ownership. Higher population density, contrary to findings in most studies, tends to reinforce vehicle ownership due to the inadequacy of public transport service, especially in crowded areas. The model was used to simulate “what if” shares of levels of vehicle ownership and apply the model under scenarios of 1) access to essential facilities, 2) improved road public transport line density, and 3) their combination. The results indicated that these interventions, relative to the baseline scenario, could respectively reduce vehicles owned by 26.63%, 35.02%, and 59.61% among the households surveyed and CO2 emission by 1.33 million tonnes, 1.63 million tonnes, and 2.69 million tonnes.",SCOPUS_ID:85073473415,"Understanding the impact of urban form attributes on household vehicle ownership and choice in metro manila: Modeling, simulation, and application",2-s2.0-85073473415,JICA,undefined,Japan International Cooperation Agency,0,False,,Journal,2019-09-16,,,25396161,3,238-247,Engineering and Applied Science Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073473415,46,,ar,Article
,Chaos | Deterministic factors | Foreign exchange rate | Largest lyapunov exponent,0,Decena M.,"© BEIESP. In most studies on dynamics of time series financial data, the absence of chaotic behavior is generally observed. However, this theory is not yet established in the dynamics of foreign exchange rates. Conflicting claims of presence and absence of chaos in foreign exchange rates open door for further investigation considering various deterministic factors. This work examines the dynamics of exchange rate of the Philippine Peso against selected foreign currencies. Time series data were collected for eight (8) of Philippine’s top trading partners as categorized according to economic condition. The data obtained with permission from the Central Bank of the Philippines covered the years 2013 to 2017. Data sets were plotted revealing non-linear movement of Philippine exchange rates against time. The foreign exchange rate time series obtained per currency were examined for chaotic behavior by computing the Largest Lyapunov Exponents (LLE). A positive Lyapunov exponent is an indication of sensitivity dependence, i.e, a chaotic dynamics; whereas, a negative Lyapunov exponent indicates otherwise. Computed LLE’s varied per currency but all were found to be negative. Therefore, using the Largest Lyapunov Exponent Test (LLE), analysis of the time series of Philippine foreign exchange rates shows little evidence of chaotic patterns.",SCOPUS_ID:85073392635,The dynamics of philippine foreign exchange rates (2013-2017): A test for Chaos,2-s2.0-85073392635,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-09-01,10.35940/ijiteeK1413.0981119,,,11,486-489,International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073392635,8,,ar,Article

Rule-based algorithms are mostly used in recommender systems but still, cannot address the issue of uncertainty in decision making particularly to senior high school students in choosing the right career track because of numerous influential factors that may affect their decisions. That is why a career track recommender system using fuzzy logic has been developed to address this issue. In this paper, the significant factors that is most influential to the decision of the students as best attributes were determined using feature selection filtering techniques and used as crisp inputs. The result shows that the developed fuzzy model performs a high predictive accuracy based on the computed mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores which decreases from the training, to the validation and test sets. The recommendation returns the best possible result based on the computed normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) which is 0.948 from the desired to the actual preference of students which is almost near to 1.0.

Ensuring data integrity is one of the critical needs in cyber-physical systems (CPS). An integrity breach in a CPS can drive the underlying controlled physical process into undesired operating conditions. To evaluate CPS security against malicious entities, attacker models are often employed. In this work, our objective is to incorporate domain-knowledge in modeling attacks in building automation systems (BAS). Specifically, we modify the general sensor integrity attack model based on targeted attacks. We use the model to formulate different attacker types, including a powerful attacker who becomes stealthier as the number of captured node increases. We simulate the attacks by injecting corruption on real-world data obtained from a retrofitted BAS testbed for air conditioning (AC) control.

The increasing number of online transactions and other internet activities give rise to the proliferation of online scam. The Philippine National Police - Anti Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) reported an increasing number of complaints from a double digit figure in 2013 to a triple digit figure in 2017. The challenge of addressing this problem in the Philippines is shared by other developing countries in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. Since 2013 when the PNP-ACG was established, cybercrime data continue to be accumulated but were not given much attention and significance in research. Previous studies highlight the importance of taking advantage of data mining. However, the absence of empirical studies on cybercrime analytics in the country connotes the lack of exploitation of data mining in facilitating cybercrime investigations. This study exploits Weka text mining tool in order to draw insights by classifying a given online scam dataset. Online scam unstructured data were considered as dataset containing a total of 14, 098 mainly Filipino words. J48 Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Sequential Minimal Optimization were used to build classification models. All these three classifiers or algorithms were compared in terms of performance and prediction accuracy. The results show that J48 achieves the highest accuracy and the lowest error rate, followed by Naïve Bayes and then the SMO classifier. Also, the responses during validation reveal that J48 is preferred over the other classifiers as it easy to understand and apply in cybercrime investigations. This demonstrates how text mining can assist the PNP-ACG in analyzing online scam criminal data as it also highlights the importance of employing data mining tools in the legal and criminal investigation domains in the Philippines.

,Cassava | Image processing | Template matching algorithm | Viola-Jones algorithm | Witches’ broom,2,Plata I.,"© 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. The Cassava Phytoplasma Disease (CPD) also known as Witches’ Broom disease is presently manifesting in some cassava fields. The infection is named after the broom-like leaf spread at the top of cassava plants. This study centered on the development and testing of an embedded system for smart detection and recognition of Witches’ Broom disease in natural environment with applied multiple layer validation procedures. The present technology in image processing applying enhanced Viola-Jones and template matching algorithm made the study possible. The embedded system was developed using Python version 3, OpenCV version 3.2.0, and Raspbian Jessie OS. The hardware includes Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and, Raspberry Pi camera module v2 with 8-megapixel camera resolution. A custom cascade classifier model comprising of image acquisition, template selection, train cascade classifier, and real-time object detection and recognition was implemented. With the implementation of two custom trained cascade classifiers, the embedded system was able to lessen the false detection rate compared to the analysis based on general features of a CPD infected cassava leaves alone, thus, increasing its detection accuracy. During the template matching process, 2 voting schemes were used to compare key features from template versus the image of object of interest and used to evaluate the overall results with the 11 templates from the score gauge, thus, these schemes were able to recognize if cassava is CPD infected or not. Currently, the downside of the study is that with the implementation of multiple layers of validation in an attempt to minimize false detection puts too much toll in the micro processing unit which is critical in attempting the detection and recognition in real-time (or close to real-time). Although detection is real time, recognition has a delay in processing the feature of the cassava whether infected or not.",SCOPUS_ID:85076059986,Development and testing of embedded system for smart detection and recognition of witches’ broom disease on cassava plants using enhanced viola-jones and template matching algorithm,2-s2.0-85076059986,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-09-01,10.30534/ijatcse/2019/113852019,,,5,2613-2621,International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076059986,8,,ar,Article

All rights reserved. Security is very essential to avoid the unauthorized exposé or modification of the information. Due to the extraordinary changes in advance these days, various mixed media information is being produced and transmitted, hence, leaving our very own information defenseless against alteration and copying. Information being transmitted through a communication system can be ensured through cryptography. In an information processing environment, cryptography is executed through a process which uses a mystery key or an arrangement of bits. This paper established a security key management scheme that provides the support necessary to protect files or records between individual end users, and that also can be used to protect data stored or conveyed from one computer to another. It contains encryption and decryption process, each related with a key which should be stayed secret through Data Encryption Standard (DES). The authors employed System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), particularly on Rapid Application Development (RAD). This method involves initial data gathering, cost and requirements’ analysis, and identification of the methods to be used in designing, testing, deploying and sustaining the system. Specifically, this paper used the block cipher approach as the main framework. The reliability of this system is measured using several tests done in the system. Experimental analysis includes testing in hardware and software components, system components, system units, and system integration and acceptance. The results showed that the performance of the system is in its best condition. There are four (4) parameters used in checking the complexity and time latency (CTL) in the DES algorithm. These were physical server, web server, network connectivity, and system. From each parameter, the system undergone three (3) phases of processes. Furthermore, questionnaires were floated to the respondents to assess the security system developed in terms of its usability, functionality, and reliability. The questionnaire was taken from an International Standard in evaluating system software called the ISO/IEC 25010:2011. The system was accomplished based from software tools like PHP, Apache, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the system development and MySQL for its database.

Once broadcast transmitters are put into operation, regulatory bodies in different countries require the equipment to be monitored, data logged and controlled. Normally, transmitter personnel turn ON the transmitter at the start of the broadcasting activities, and turn it OFF at the end of the activities. They also regularly record the transmitter meter readings on output power, voltage and current as long as the transmitter is on-air. These data must be logged and saved for future references. These procedures are done by transmitter personnel manually. With the advent of internet technology, this paper presents a system to remotely monitor, gather and record meter readings, and a provision to control the turning ON/OFF as well as to adjust the output power of a number of digital transmitters. All these procedures are done in one central location. The system was implemented and then tested using a digital television transmitter.

,Analog transmitter | Analog transmitter control | Analog transmitter monitoring | Remote metering | Remote monitoring,0,Mappatao G.,"© 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Technicians periodically monitor the transmitter performance, record the supply voltage and current at the last stage of the power amplifier and keeps a copy for at least two years. Also recorded are the times the transmitter is turned ON and OFF as well as the times the transmitter shuts down and returns back to air. This paper proposes a system to remotely tend analog transmitters in one central moni toring station. The remote tending of several transmitters in one location is made possible through internet connection. However, the challenge in the proposed system is in the gathering of transmitter data. A prototype of the system was constructed and tested in an FM broadcast transmitter.

Despite recent improvements, the arbitrary sizes of objects still impede the predictive ability of object detectors. Recent solutions combine feature maps of different receptive fields to detect multi-scale objects. However, these methods have large computational costs resulting to slower inference time, which is not practical for real-time applications. Contrarily, fusion methods depending on large networks with many skip connections demand larger memory requirement, prohibiting usage in devices with limited memory. In this paper, we propose a more computationally efficient fusion method which integrates higher-order information to low-level feature maps using a single operation. Our method can flexibly adapt to any base network, allowing tailored performance for different computational requirements. Our approach achieves 81.7% mAP at 41 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset using ResNet-50 as the base network, which is superior in terms of both speed and mAP as compared to several state-of-the-art baselines, even those which use larger base networks.",SCOPUS_ID:85076817652,Single-Fusion Detector: Towards Faster Multi-Scale Object Detection,2-s2.0-85076817652,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-09-01,10.1109/ICIP.2019.8802913,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538662496'}]",15224880,,76-80,"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076817652,2019-September,,cp,Conference Paper

However, these methods are designed to generate only one object with varying attributes. They face difficulties with complex descriptions having multiple arbitrary objects since it would require information on the placement and sizes of each object in the image. Recently, a method that infers object layouts from scene graphs has been proposed as a solution to this problem. However, their method uses only object labels in describing the layout, which fail to capture the appearance of some objects. Moreover, their model is biased towards generating rectangular shaped objects in the absence of ground-truth masks. In this paper, we propose an object encoding module to capture object features and use it as additional information to the image generation network. We also introduce a graph-cuts based segmentation method that can infer the masks of objects from bounding boxes to better model object shapes. Our method produces more discernible images with more realistic shapes as compared to the images generated by the current state-of-the-art method.",SCOPUS_ID:85076805371,Layout and Context Understanding for Image Synthesis with Scene Graphs,2-s2.0-85076805371,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-09-01,10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803182,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538662496'}]",15224880,,1905-1909,"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076805371,2019-September,,cp,Conference Paper

Incipient fault prognosis is an important task in industrial process monitoring, as it deals with the prediction of the degradation of a faulty process until a failure threshold is reached. For multivariate processes working under varying operating conditions, the existing challenge is to distinguish the non-stationary fault trend from the usual process dynamic trends present in the measured signals. In this paper, canonical variate analysis with Kalman filtering is proposed to reconstruct the fault signal against a reference signal predicted from a state-space model of the normal process. Vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling is then used for the long-term prediction of fault signals in order to compute the remaining useful life (RUL) of the process. Hence, the approach constitutes an efficient fault prognosis method for dynamic multivariate processes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using incipient fault case studies in a chemical reactor process.",SCOPUS_ID:85075775803,Reconstruction based fault prognosis in dynamic processes using canonical variate analysis,2-s2.0-85075775803,UP,undefined,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala",0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-09-01,10.23919/IConAC.2019.8895249,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781861376664'}]",,,,ICAC 2019 - 2019 25th IEEE International Conference on Automation and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075775803,,,cp,Conference Paper
3788,Chaotic search | Chicken swarm optimization algorithm | Least squares support vector machine | Storage system | Sustainable lithium-ion battery,1,Liu Z.,"© 2019 by the authors. In photovoltaic and wind power storage systems, the reliability of the battery directly affects the overall reliability of the energy storage system. Failed batteries can seriously affect the stable operation of energy storage systems. This paper aims to improve the reliability of the storage systems by accurately predicting battery life and identifying failing batteries in time. The current prediction models mainly use artificial neural networks, Gaussian process regression and hybrid models. Although these models can achieve high prediction accuracy, the computational cost is high due to model complexity. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is a computationally efficient alternative. Hence, this study combines the improved chicken swarm optimization algorithm (ICSO) and LSSVM into a hybrid ICSO-LSSVM model for the reliability of photovoltaic and wind power storage systems. The following are the contributions of this work. First, the optimal penalty parameter and kernel width are determined. Second, the chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) is improved by introducing chaotic search behavior in the hen and an adaptive learning factor in the chicks. The performance of the ICSO algorithm is shown to be better than CSO using standard test problems. Third, the prediction accuracy of the three models is compared. For NMC1 battery, the predicted relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 0.94%; for NMC2 battery, the relative error of ICSO-LSSVM is 1%. These findings show that the proposed model is suitable for predicting the failure of batteries in energy storage systems, which can improve preventive and predictive maintenance of such systems.",SCOPUS_ID:85072375635,Improving the reliability of photovoltaic and wind power storage systems using least squares support vector machine optimized by improved chicken swarm algorithm,2-s2.0-85072375635,,19JCZDJC32100,Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin-Science and Technology Correspondent Project,1,True,,Journal,2019-09-01,10.3390/app9183788,,,18,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072375635,9,,ar,Article

,Disaster Management | Evacuation Centers | GIS | Metro Manila | Spatial Distribution | Urban,0,Cajucom E.,"© 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. In a densely populated and hazard-prone megalopolis like Metro Manila, the ability to execute a rapid evacuation protocol is crucial in saving lives and minimizing the damage during disastrous events. However, there is no centralized database on the location of evacuation centers (ECs) in Metro Manila and the available lists are not up-to-date. This study geotagged the current list of ECs in Metro Manila obtained from different government agencies to evaluate the spatial distribution using Geographical Information System (GIS). This is important since the immediate evacuation of residents depends on the proximity and safe location of the ECs. A total of 870 ECs were geo-tagged and validated using the street view of Google EarthTM. EC-to-population ratios were calculated for each of the 16 cities and one municipality of Metro Manila. Values range from ∼3,000 to 81,000 persons per EC. Distance analysis using Thiessen Polygon shows that the ECs are not evenly distributed with proximity areas ranging from 0.0009 to 9.5 km2. Out of the total number of mapped ECs, 392 (45%) are situated in flood-prone areas while 108 (12%) are within the 1-km buffer hazard zone of an active faultline.

,Frequency ratio | GIS | Landslide database | Landslide susceptibility | Philippines,0,Javier D.,"© 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. In a high-rainfall, landslide-prone region in this tropical mountain region, a landslide database was constructed from high resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), local reports and field observations. The landslide data was divided into training (80%) and validation sets (20%). From the digital elevation model (DEM), scanned maps and HRSI, twelve landslide conditioning factors were derived and analysed in a GIS environment: elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to drainage, soil type, lithology, distance to fault/lineament, land use/land cover, distance to road and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landslide susceptibility was then estimated using the frequency ratio method as applied on the training data. The detailed procedure is explained herein. The landslide model generated was then evaluated using the validation data set. Results demonstrate that the very high, high, moderate, low and very low susceptibility classes included an average of 86%, 7%, 4%, 3% and 1% of the training cells, and 84%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 1% of the validation cells, respectively.

,Disengagement | Eye tracking | Head movement | Online lecture | Visual attention,0,Basinillo A.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Technologies such as online lecture presentations are now provided to students to cater their learning through digital means. Unfortunately, student’s engagement during online classes is uncertain. To partially address this problem, we developed models that can detect student disengagement using some well-known decision tree classifiers. Results showed that Random Forest using Information Gain criterion provided the highest accuracy rate of 91.73% and kappa statistic of 0.74. It was also observed that majority of the internal nodes of the tree models are features extracted from eye tracking. This includes: the time duration of the eye seen, the distance of the iris from the center of the eye, and the distance travelled by the iris.

Finally, we significantly noticed that: in every 450 video frames, if the eye is seen for less than 76 frames and an average angle of head pitch is less than or equal to 46.5 degrees with respect to the negative y-axis, the student is most likely disengaged.

Determining the ability of children to focus in a very young age is something that is very important for adults to know for them to understand the child’s learning capability. The development of their attention skills during their younger years affects how much excellence they can perform during their adolescence stage. Since most attention detection researches are frequently done through eye gaze detection, this research is focused on detecting the attention of a child through facial expressions. The proposed system shows that basing from a child’s facial expression, it can determine their attention skills which has given accurate results. A total of forty (40) grade one (1) students took part in this research. The data gathered was in the form of a recorded video obtained from the web camera. Each video was processed frame by frame to extract necessary facial features that is needed in determining the facial expression through OpenFace application. SVM algorithm was used in training and testing the model’s validity. The model is written in a Java Programming Language and has an output of a subtitle file which will be imported into the recorded video. From there, the subtitle file has a label of the student’s facial expression, thus determines their attention.

8877126,Cognitive radio networks | Cooperative sensing | Dynamic spectrum access | Energy detection,0,Vidal A.,"© 2019 IEEE. Many communities in the world, especially in rural and underdeveloped regions, still have no access to cellular connectivity. The low return of investment for telecommunication companies prevent the entry of middle and last mile infrastructure, consisting of relatively expensive equipment, in these places. Although advances in software-defined radio technology have lowered operation costs of installing Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs), access to appropriate spectrum resources still hinders the deployment and sustainable operation of these technologies in these settings. In a scenario where both licensed and unlicensed networks are allowed to co-exist and share spectrum resources, the unlicensed network must proactively detect transmissions from other networks to avoid interfering with incumbent GSM networks (primary user or PU) while maintaining radio link between base stations and mobiles. In this paper, we present a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) protocol for secondary networks operating in the GSM-900 band. In the proposed DSA protocol, the secondary BTS distributes frequency lists over active mobiles for sensing, on top of energy detection by the BTS for detecting PUs in the current channel it considers to use. Using IEEE 802.22 requirements for Wireless Regional Access Networks, we show that for a false alarm rate of 10%, beacon transmissions as low as-95 dBm over 30 frequency channels can be scanned every 960 ms with 90% detection probability using uplink measurement reports transmitted through the Slow Associated Control Channel. Under same sensing requirements, we show that downlink GSM signals as low as-80.1 dBm can be detected using BTS-side energy detection. The sensing performance of the DSA protocol helps assure licensed networks of non-interference while enabling unlicensed networks to provide basic cellular communications in unserved and underserved communities.",SCOPUS_ID:85074650402,Cooperative mobile sensing for dynamic spectrum access in community cellular networks,2-s2.0-85074650402,PCARI,undefined,Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-08-01,10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877126,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728125275'}]",21540217,,709-713,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074650402,2019-August,,cp,Conference Paper

This includes techniques learned that is based on traditional methods, practices, experiences, environmental patterns and human capability. The most sought technique comes from human intelligence that is dynamic, adaptive and robust. Nitrogen deficiency in rice plants can be determined via the color of the leaves. It is dependent on the depth of the green pigment in the color spectrum present in the leaves. Based on these characteristics, the application of computational artificial intelligence and machine vision can be adopted to create assistive technologies for agriculture. In this paper, a mobile application is developed and implemented that can be used to assist rice farmers determine nitrogen deficiency, through the leaf color in rice plants. The application can be used alternatively or together with the traditional protocol of nitrogen fertilizer management. It is mobile, simple and it also addresses some drawbacks of the human eye to distinguish color depths brought about by other factors, like sunlight, shading, humidity, temperature, etc. It utilizes image processing techniques to digitally captured images represented in numerically transformed Red, Green, and Blue color formats. The digital images are then normalized to remove the effects of illumination and then compared using the image/pixel subtraction technique with the base color images converted and extracted from the leaf color chart standard.

,combined stress | drought stress | flowering | grain filling | heat stress | marker metabolites | metabolomics | recovery | rice (Oryza sativa),0,Lawas L.,"© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. BACKGROUND: Drought and heat stress effects on rice have been extensively studied, in particular during the sensitive flowering and grain-filling stages. However, in the field these stresses usually occur together because reduced transpirational cooling under drought conditions results in increased plant tissue temperature. In addition, environmental stresses are usually transient and the ability to efficiently recover from stress may be at least as important for overall stress tolerance as the direct stress response itself. Nevertheless, nothing is known about recovery mechanisms after drought and heat stress in rice under field conditions. RESULTS: We have used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to elucidate the metabolic responses of flag leaves, flowering spikelets, and developing seeds from 3 rice cultivars differing in their drought and heat tolerance to rewatering after stress in the field. Within 60 hours after rewatering, many stress-responsive metabolites returned to their control levels, although recovery was not complete. In addition, control plants showed developmental differences that were revealed by metabolite profiles during 60 hours of post-stress sampling, in particular in developing seeds. Correlation analysis identified several metabolites as marker candidates for the stability of grain yield or quality under conditions of combined drought and heat stress. CONCLUSIONS: The rewatering responses of stressed plants seemed to be a combination of the reversal of stress effects and reinitiation of development after stress relief. The identified potential markers can be useful in efforts to breed stress-tolerant rice germplasm to ensure food availability under changing climate conditions.",SCOPUS_ID:85071553916,Metabolic responses of rice source and sink organs during recovery from combined drought and heat stress in the field,2-s2.0-85071553916,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-08-01,10.1093/gigascience/giz102,,,8,,GigaScience,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071553916,8,31433831.0,ar,Article
101568,Doppler shift | PCA | S-shaped riser | SVM,2,Nnabuife S.,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The accurate prediction of flow regimes is vital for the analysis of behaviour and operation of gas/liquid two-phase systems in industrial processes. This paper investigates the feasibility of a non-radioactive and non-intrusive method for the objective identification of two-phase gas/liquid flow regimes using a Doppler ultrasonic sensor and machine learning approaches. The experimental data is acquired from a 16.2-m long S-shaped riser, connected to a 40-m horizontal pipe with an internal diameter of 50.4 mm. The tests cover the bubbly, slug, churn and annular flow regimes. The power spectral density (PSD)method is applied to the flow modulated ultrasound signals in order to extract frequency-domain features of the two-phase flow. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)is then used to reduce the dimensionality of the data so as to enable visualisation in the form of a virtual flow regime map. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM)is deployed to develop an objective classifier in the reduced space. The classifier attained 85.7% accuracy on training samples and 84.6% accuracy on test samples. Our approach has shown the success of the ultrasound sensor, PCA-SVM, and virtual flow regime maps for objective two-phase flow regime classification on pipeline-riser systems, which is beneficial to operators in industrial practice. The use of a non-radioactive and non-intrusive sensor also makes it more favorable than other existing techniques.",SCOPUS_ID:85066245209,Identification of gas-liquid flow regimes using a non-intrusive Doppler ultrasonic sensor and virtual flow regime maps,2-s2.0-85066245209,,undefined,,0,False,S0955598618303686,Journal,2019-08-01,10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2019.05.002,,09555986,,,Flow Measurement and Instrumentation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066245209,68,,ar,Article

Lowland rice in tropical and subtropical regions can be detected precisely and its crop growth can be tracked effectively through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, especially where cloud cover restricts the use of optical imagery. Parameterised classification with multi-temporal features derived from regularly acquired, C-band, VV and VH polarized Sentinel-1A SAR imagery was used for mapping rice area. A fully automated processing chain in MAPscape-Rice software was used to convert the multi-temporal SAR data into terrain-JHRFRGHG ı YDOXHV which included strip mosaicking, co-registration of images acquired with the same observation geometry and mode, time-series speckle filtering, terrain geocoding, radiometric calibration and normalization. Further Anisotropic non-linear diffusion (ANLD) filtering was done to smoothen homogeneous targets, while enhancing the difference between neighbouring areas. Multi-Temporal Features viz., max, min, mean, max date, min date and span ratio were extracted from VV and VH polarizations to classify rice pixels. Rice detection was based on the analysis of temporal signature from SAR backscatter in relation to crop stages. About sixty images across four footprints covering 16 samba (Rabi) rice growing districts of Tamil Nadu, India were obtained between August 2017 and January2018. In-season site visits were conducted across 280 monitoring locations in the footprints for classification purposes and more than 1665 field observations were made for accuracy assessment. A total rice area of 1.07 million ha was mapped with classification accuracy from 90.3 to 94.2 per cent with Kappa values ranging from 0.81 to 0.88. Using ORYZA2000, a weather driven process based crop growth simulation model developed by IRRI, yield estimates were made by integrating remote sensing products viz., seasonal rice area, start of season and backscatter time series. By generating average backscatter for each time series and dB stack for each SoS, LAI values were estimated. The model has generated rice yield estimate for each hectare which were aggregated at administrative boundary level and compared against CCE yield. Yield Simulation accuracy of more than 86-91% at district level and 82-97% at block level from the study indicates the suitability of these products for policy decisions. SAR products and yield information were used to meet the requirements of PMFBY crop insurance scheme in Tamil Nadu and helped in identifying or invoking prevented/failed sowing in 529 villages and total crop failure in 821 villages. In total 303703 farmers were benefitted by this technology in getting payouts of INR 9.94 billion through crop insurance.

Mapping the extent of damage due to natural calamities remains one of the thrust areas in monitoring resource inventory through geo-spatial techniques. The effect of the cyclone 'Titli' and heavy rains during first fortnight of October 2018 in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh State has been demonstrated using geo-spatial technology in terms of flood inundated rice area and corresponding yield and production loss. The pre- and post-cyclone (5 and 13 October 2018) flood inundation maps were generated using Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data respectively. The pre-cyclone rice area estimates were derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data, while yield forecast is based on the combination of satellite observations and yield simulation using ORYZA crop growth model. An intensive ground truth data collection had been carried out for the validation of satellite-derived rice area estimation of pre-cyclone event. An accuracy assessment has been carried out for district, mandal and village level. An overall accuracy of 96% with kappa coefficient 0.92 has been achieved. With the help map flood inundation and rice area maps, mandal-wise flood affected rice area and corresponding yield loss have been estimated. The post-cyclone ground truth data had been collected for quantitative assessment of crop damaged area. An overall accuracy of the flood affected rice map was 85% with kappa coefficient 0.70.

On today's world where data and information is available on almost everywhere, the security of these data and information are being attacked every day. Security enhancements are being done in order to make it more secure. One of the cryptographic techniques that is being used to secure data is the Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) and one of its primary components is the Substitution box (S-box). It is the only nonlinear part of AES thus it is prone to attacks. The paper produced a modified S-box with the combination of the original S-box and the S-box produced using the Logistic Map. Adjustments were made to meet the bijective property of an S-box. It was then evaluated using balance, bijective property, nonlinearity, bit independence criterion and strict avalanche criterion. The results have met the bijective and balance property of AES with the adjustment discussed. Its nonlinearity was tested using S-box Evaluation Tool (SET) and achieved a result of 94. Its Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) scored 0.5234375, and Bit Independence Criterion (BIC) has -0.0275 result.

Authentication plays a crucial role in information security by which several mechanisms are widely used to protect services from attacks. Graphical password is the most popular mechanism and frequently assert the advantage that they are significantly more secure. However, most graphical passwords are susceptible to shoulder surfing attack. To overcome this problem, this study proposed a hotspot guessing attack resistant graphical password authentication scheme based on the modified PassMatrix method. The modification involves replacing the single discretized image of the PassMatrix method into several independent images and applying a random grid traversal method. The proposed Jumbled PassSteps was evaluated in terms of its usability. Experimental results showed that the users were able to remember their graphical passwords successfully as the memorability percentage reached 100.00% and 90.90% in the first and second session respectively.

Fish is a perishable good, which can get easily putrefied in a short span of time. To maintain the fish’s quality freshness must be preserved, so as not to cause harm to the consumer. This study is aimed at determining a classification technique on which to base the milkfish’s freshness using a modified set of features like wavelet transform coefficients and support vector machine. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the tool in which forms a link between feed-forward neural networks and Coiflet wavelet filter. The Coiflet filter uses six scaling functions to increase the pixel averages and differences, resulting in a smoother wavelet and increased performance capability. As a result, the system’s output showed that the accuracy result of the eyes is 89.9%, gills 90.9% and body 88.8%.

8806077,,0,Go S.,"© 2019 IEEE. The widespread adoption of social networking and cloud computing has transformed today's Internet to a trove of personal information. As a consequence, data breaches are expected to increase in gravity and occurrence. To counteract unintended data disclosure, a great deal of effort has been dedicated in devising methods for uncovering privacy leaks. Existing solutions, however, have not addressed the time- and data-intensive nature of leak detection. The shift from hardware-specific implementation to software-based solutions is the core idea behind the concept of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). On the other hand, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is characterized by the decoupling of the forwarding and control planes. In this paper, an SDN/NFV-enabled architecture is proposed for improving the efficiency of leak detection systems. Employing a previously developed identification strategy, Personally Identifiable Information detector (PIID) and load balancer VNFs are packaged and deployed in OpenStack through an NFV MANO. Meanwhile, SDN controllers permit the load balancer to dynamically redistribute traffic among the PIID instances. In a physical testbed, tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results indicate that the proportions of forwarding and parsing on total overhead is influenced by the traffic intensity. Furthermore, an NFV-enabled system with scalability features was found to outperform a non-virtualized implementation in terms of latency (85.1%), packet loss (98.3%) and throughput (8.41%).",SCOPUS_ID:85071881458,An SDN/NFV-Enabled Architecture for Detecting Personally Identifiable Information Leaks on Network Traffic,2-s2.0-85071881458,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ICUFN.2019.8806077,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728113395'}]",21658528,,306-311,"International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks, ICUFN",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071881458,2019-July,,cp,Conference Paper

The lack of assurance about the random numbers generated can cause serious damage to cryptographic protocols, prompting vulnerabilities to be exploited by the attackers. In this paper, a new pseudo - random number generator algorithm that uses dynamic system clock converted to Epoch Timestamp as PRNG seed was developed. The algorithm uses a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm that produces a sequence of pseudo - randomized numbers that performs mathematical operations to transform numbers that appears to be unrelated to the Seed. Simulation result shows that the new PRNG algorithm does not generate repeated random numbers based on the frequency of iteration, a good indicator that the key for random numbers is secured. Numerical analysis using NIST Test Suite results concerning to random sequences generated random numbers has a total average of 0.342 P-value. For a p-value ≥ 0.001, a sequence would be considered to be random with a confidence of 99.9%. This shows that robustness and unpredictability were achieved. Hence, It is highly deterministic in nature and has a good quality of Pseudo-Random Numbers.

8806072,building automation system | cyber-physical system | data integrity attack | sensors,0,Calimbahin C.,"© 2019 IEEE. Building automation systems (BAS) are a class of cyber-physical systems that aim to improve the efficiency of buildings through intelligent control. Typically, sensor measurements are used to compute for the optimal control action for equipment that minimizes the energy consumption while maintaining the comfort of occupants. Given the heavy reliance on sensor data, ensuring their validity is an essential concern in BAS. Several work have explored sensor validation, mostly for the purpose of automatic fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD). However, recent studies show BAS vulnerable to adversarial attacks - an area that has lacked consideration in the early design of BAS.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs)are vital to numerous biological processes. Computational methods have been used to predict PPIs from protein sequences. Several studies utilize popular algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM)and Random Forest (RF)for detecting PPIs. The hypothesis of this study is that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which uses gradient boosted decision trees as the base classifier, can produce comparable results to those produced by SVM and RF.

8782240,Blended learning | Neural network | Student performance prediction,0,Raga R.,"© 2019 IEEE. In this paper, we experimented on developing prediction models for student performance in early stages of blended learning courses using deep neural network (NN) architecture and utilizing online activity attributes as input patterns. The online activity attributes were extracted from the activity logs stored by Moodle. A total of 885 records from undergraduate students taking three 3 different courses under 16 different classes were utilized. First, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the hyperparameters for a top performing NN model which then served as baseline classifier. Afterward, experiments were conducted to test the performance of the model for predicting student outcomes (pass or fail) both for the midterm and finals period using activity data generated prior to the midterm period. Results indicate that only low prediction performance can be achieved at an early stage, more specifically during the first month of the course. However, both accuracy, as well as ROC-AUC score, improves as more data is accumulated up to the third month. This result supports the findings from previous studies. The highest accuracy achieved for predicting finals outcomes for a single course is 91.07% with ROC-AUC score of 0.88 while for midterm outcomes the highest is 80.36% accuracy with ROC-AUC score of 0.70. This study is a part of an ongoing work that aims to develop a tool that can be applied in selected blended learning dimensions to provide a basis for automatic feedback and instructor support.",SCOPUS_ID:85071007069,Early prediction of student performance in blended learning courses using deep neural networks,2-s2.0-85071007069,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ISET.2019.00018,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728133874'}]",,,39-43,"Proceedings - 2019 International Symposium on Educational Technology, ISET 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071007069,,,cp,Conference Paper

8935969,finite element method | least square polynomial approximation (LSPA) | soft pneumatic bending actuator | soft robotics,0,Enojas M.,"© 2019 IEEE. A growing research and development of soft manipulators that are able to mimic movements of human hand for prostheses and rehabilitation is one of the main streams in advanced robotics technologies. Soft compliant materials are overtaking the role of hard materials for this cause. This paper presents a model of soft pneumatic bending actuator (sPBA) to mimic the movements of a finger. The sPBA developed is composed of air chambers connected together with a common channel that bends symmetrically, achieving the bending characteristics of a finger joint. Three actuators which act as joints are connected to form a finger. Finite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the pressure and bending characteristics of the model prior to fabrication. The materials used in the model are the hyper elastic silicon rubbers; Dragon Skin 10 Medium (DS10M) and Elastosil M4601 (EM4601). The kinematic model of the planar movement of the actuator is based on the assumption of a rigid multiple-link hyper redundant structure. The inverse kinematics is solved using sequential quadratic programming algorithm (SQPA) as an optimization function in a numerical computing environment software. The constraint equation used in solving the joint angles is the forward kinematics equation. The derived least square polynomial equations are used to estimate the pressure. The cost functions are defined to minimize displacement error. In addition, a prototype was developed to validate the movement of the designed finger. The results present an acceptable maximum displacement error at low pressure of 3.4%. The bending was successfully achieved having the same pose as that of the FEM simulation and is also able to grip an object.",SCOPUS_ID:85078031524,Development of a Finger Soft Pneumatic Bending Actuator,2-s2.0-85078031524,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ACIRS.2019.8935969,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728122298'}]",,,1-5,"2019 4th Asia-Pacific Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems, ACIRS 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078031524,,,cp,Conference Paper
8905976,global navigation satellite system | ionosphere | ionospheric irregularities | roti,0,Juadines K.,"© 2019 IEEE. When radio signals encounter ionospheric irregularities while being transmitted, they appear to be rapid signal fluctuations. These rapid fluctuations in radio signals are called scintillation and the irregularities that cause them are found in the ionosphere around 300-500 km altitude. In this paper, the occurrence of low-latitude ionospheric irregularities over the Philippine sector using 8 Global Navigation Satellite System receivers from the Philippine Active Geodetic Network (PageNET) on March 2015 was observed through the rate of change of total electron content index (ROTI). The 5-minute ROTI was calculated from raw GNSS data from the PageNET receivers. High ROTI values were mostly observed during post-sunset (1200 UT or 8:00 PM local time) and lasted for about 3-4 hours. This shows that generally, ionospheric irregularities are present during this time of the day. However, when a strong geomagnetic storm hit Earth, the usual occurrence of these irregularities appears to be suppressed. According to Nayak et.al. (2017), the suppression was due to the reduced pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) electric field which caused a condition detrimental to the formation of ionospheric irregularities. Moreover, ROTI values correlated very well with the station's latitude where higher latitudes exhibited higher ROTI than latitudes near the geomagnetic equator. This corresponds to the presence of the equatorial ionization anomaly.",SCOPUS_ID:85077999662,Observation of Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities using Rate of Change of Total Electron Content over the Philippine Sector,2-s2.0-85077999662,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/IconSpace.2019.8905976,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538683941'}]",21654301,,112-115,"International Conference on Space Science and Communication, IconSpace",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077999662,2019-July,,cp,Conference Paper
8905982,Global Navigation Satellite System | Ionosphere | Solar Flares | Total Electron Content,0,Mendoza M.,"© 2019 IEEE. The Sun produced a series of solar flares during the month of September. There were seven solar flares during the period of 4 September 17 to 10 September 2017. It started with an M5.5 solar flare at September 4, 2017, followed by an X2.2 solar flare on September 6, 2017, and at a later time, an X9.3 solar flare. A M7.3 solar flare occured on 7 September 2017, followed by an X1.3 solar flare on the same day. A M8.1 solar flare on 8 September 2017 happened and it ended with an X8.2 solar flare on 10 September 2017. The X9.3 solar flare of September 2017 is the strongest of the seven consecutive flares originating from active sunspot region 2673. Two of these flares produced a G4 Storm. The first to hit is from the X9.3 flare at 22 UT of 6 September 2017 and the other from a M7.3 flare at 13 UT of 8 September 2017. The series of continuous bombardment of coronal mass ejections and solar flares caused enhancements in the total electron content (TEC) as observed from ground based International GNSS Service (IGS) receivers. A 15-day observation period from 1 September 2017 to 1 September 2017 is selected such that comparison between the quiet and disturbed periods of the ionosphere can be observed during the series of flares. There are five International GNSS Service (IGS) stations selected over Philippines and Taiwan such that a latitudinal variation over the equatorial regions are highlighted. This storm caused an enhancement of about 15 TEC units (TECU), (1 TECU = 1012electrons / m2) as measured on International GNSS Service (IGS) stations along the Taiwanese and Philippine sectors. This agrees with the TEC observations made by Yasyukevich et al.

A number of reports about ambush among soldiers costing most of their lives have been recently reported as they try to uphold peace and safety among the individuals living in a certain place. Knowing where the gunshots came from is an advantage for the soldiers to have better aim. The purpose of the study is to aid soldiers in times of combat to avoid relatively large unpredictable loss and to safeguard our territories from unconscious attacks by developing a gunshot classification and localization system. This study utilized the adaptive ability of an Artificial Neural network (ANN) in the classification and localization of gunshots using microphones as the primary sensors. The system consists of two modules: the classification and localization module. Sound signal properties were used to distinguished gunshot from background noise and other explosive acoustics such as firecrackers; the difference in time of arrival and signal strengths of the muzzle blast and shockwave were used to locate the origin of the gunshot sound. Around a thousand rounds of M16 gunshots where used to qualify the performance of the system. The system achieved around a rate of 99 percent in distinguishing M16 gunshots from that of background noise or firecrackers. On the other hand, the test result for localization showed that the system is capable of providing more than 90 percent accuracy for the source angle orientation and more than 90 percent was also observed for the source distance orientation.",SCOPUS_ID:85073571506,Gunshot classification and localization system using artificial neural network (ANN),2-s2.0-85073571506,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ICTS.2019.8850937,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728121338'}]",,,98-102,"Proceedings of 2019 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology and Systems, ICTS 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073571506,,,cp,Conference Paper

The code used in this study is developed by Makeshkha. This system uses an extraction feature which extracts the parts of the image of the hand gesture which is to be used by the system, and a neural network. This system has been trained for numerous iterations with the use of different input images. The network is then used in the recognition of hand number gestures. The system works by first prompting the user for an image to be used for input. The next process is the extraction of the features which goes by the reprocessing of the image through the removal or addition of noise in order to extract the required shape and form of the hand. Lastly, the Artificial Neural Network then scans the database for similarities in the image, with regards to the extracted features, from the input image. The experimental results of the study showed that the system has a considerable percentage of accuracy in the recognition of hand number gestures.",SCOPUS_ID:85073357619,A study on number gesture recognition using neural network,2-s2.0-85073357619,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-07-01,10.30534/ijatcse/2019/14842019,,,4,1076-1082,International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073357619,8,,ar,Article

8835265,Alarm node | Detection node | Fire Detection and Alarm System | Wireless Sensor Network,0,Piera P.,"© 2019 IEEE. Fire can really be devastating to properties if improperly managed, it is due to this problem that the fire detection and alarm systems were sought for. However, traditional fire alarm system is based on a wiring network which have drawbacks and limitations such as inflexibility of the FDAS layout plan during building construction, and difficulties in renovation where the removal and relocation of traditional FDAS requires additional amount of work. To address these problems, a fire detection and alarm system that is based on wireless sensor network was developed. The FDAS is mainly composed of a fire detection node, a fire alarm node, and a fire alarm control panel. The wireless communication of the nodes was achieved using XBee as the wireless transceiver. The significant characteristic of XBee is the mesh routing protocol which helps the system to be more robust and flexible. The fire alarm control panel is a LabVIEW based program that utilizes the state machine architecture which follows the detect-evaluate-store algorithm. In evaluating the overall system, results illustrate the network of nodes adapts to its location and connects to other nodes whenever it is within their range. Furthermore, the average response time of each detection node with respect to the fire alarm control panel is below the standard of 10-second as stated by the National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code.",SCOPUS_ID:85073260486,A wireless sensor network for fire detection and alarm system,2-s2.0-85073260486,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology for Social Development,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ICoICT.2019.8835265,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538680520'}]",,,,"2019 7th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073260486,,,cp,Conference Paper

Nowadays, there are many ways to get the Internet connection such as ADSL, Mobile, Wifi, WiMax, Fttx. Furthermore, the Internet connection can get anywhere and any times. In fact, the PBX systems would be low interested because the PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is used circuit switching system and is also used to expend the phone bills [1]. The VoIP system uses the packet switching which it can use everywhere in the place of getting an Internet connection. Moreover, the Phone bill costs are lowest and flexible to use in the new era. In this paper, the VoIP technology is used bandwidth control and line aggregation to get the network speed in the network infrastructure. Moreover, the traffic and bandwidth of each port and whole systems can monitor and manage. In this paper, the OSPF, Ether channel and bandwidth monitoring system are used in real time simulations. All of systems are used the Cisco devices, Linux and windows OS and line aggregations. Line aggregation means line compositions. One switch port can use 100 Mbps/ 1Gbps. On the other hand, if the port is 1Gbps, the four ports are used that it may be 4Gbps. Moreover, not only line combination, but also link redundancy.

Achieving interoperability in healthcare leads to several benefits that affect consumers and other stakeholders. With this, several countries have already implemented a Health Information Exchange (HIE) to enable interoperability in their areas. OpenHIE [5] is an initiative that aims to address the interoperability challenges in underserved regions, such as third-world countries. OpenHIE provides a framework for implementing an HIE which is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Its design has been proven to work, and other countries and organizations have shown interest in adopting its components. Currently, OpenHIE can provide the de facto standard for securing health information systems. However, several essential security features concerning the privacy of health information have yet to be implemented. Here we explore the application of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) on OpenHIE to realize the aforementioned security features. Results show that applying CP-ABE will not only change the implementation of the functionalities of the HIE, but it will also add an overhead to its non-functional characteristics, such as the number of transactions per second, memory, and bandwidth usage.",SCOPUS_ID:85071886779,Evaluating the Viability of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption on Service-Oriented Health Information Exchange Systems,2-s2.0-85071886779,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/ICUFN.2019.8806133,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728113395'}]",21658528,,443-448,"International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks, ICUFN",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071886779,2019-July,,cp,Conference Paper
,Convolutional Neural Network | Field Programmable Gate Array | Hardware Model | K-Means Clustering | VHDL | Weight Compression,1,Yap R.,"© 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. In this paper, a design of a synthesizable hardware model for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is presented. The hardware model is capable of self-training i.e. without the use of any external processors. It is trained to recognize four numerical digit images. Another hardware model is also designed for the K-means clustering algorithm. This second hardware model is used to for compressing the weights of the CNN through quantization. Weight compression is carried out through weight sharing. With weight sharing, the system is able to save component usage. The two hardware models designed are then subsequently integrated to automate the compression of the CNN weights after the CNN completes its training. The entire design is based on fixed point arithmetic operation using VHDL as design entry tool and XILINX Virtex 5 FPGA as the target library for synthesis. After completing the design, it is evaluated in terms of hardware consumption with respect to rate of compression. When evaluating the recognition performance ability of the hardware model, digit images experimentation results have shown that the weight compression can reach as high as 60% without any negative effect on the performance of the CNN. Based on data gathered, the compression with the least hardware consumption occurs at 80 %.

,Deep learning applications to the environment | Fish detection in the wild,2,Labao A.,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. We propose a fish detection system based on deep network architectures to robustly detect and count fish objects under a variety of benthic background and illumination conditions. The algorithm consists of an ensemble of Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks that are linked in a cascade structure by Long Short-Term Memory networks. The proposed network is efficiently trained as all components are jointly trained by backpropagation. We train and test our system for a dataset of 18 videos taken in the wild. In our dataset, there are around 20 to 100 fish objects per frame with many fish objects having small pixel areas (less than 900 square pixels). From a series of experiments and ablation tests, the proposed system preserves detection accuracy despite multi-scale distortions, cropping and varying background environments. We present analysis that shows how object localization accuracy is increased by an automatic correction mechanism in the deep network's cascaded ensemble structure. The correction mechanism rectifies any errors in the predictions as information progresses through the network cascade. Our findings in this experiment regarding ensemble system architectures can be generalized to other object detection applications.",SCOPUS_ID:85065969675,Cascaded deep network systems with linked ensemble components for underwater fish detection in the wild,2-s2.0-85065969675,,undefined,"Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development",0,False,S1574954118303078,Journal,2019-07-01,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.004,,15749541,,103-121,Ecological Informatics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065969675,52,,ar,Article
8905958,Differntial Code Bias | Global Navigation Satellite System | Ionosphere | Total Electron Content,0,Mendoza M.,"© 2019 IEEE. Ionospheric total electron content (TEC) is an essential parameter in the study of space weather. With the advent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology, ionospheric TEC can be measured using dual-frequency GNSS receivers. TEC can be estimated along the signal path connecting the satellite and receiver. However, an unknown instrumental bias called the differential code bias (DCB), is inherent upon measurements which causes errors on TEC calculations. These are usually in the form of biases in TEC values. The International GNSS Service (IGS) provides these biases but only for its own network. In this study, a method for determining the unknown TEC bias for stations outside the IGS network is presented. This is done by first determining a stable absolute minimum TEC on a given day provided by the Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM). The TEC derived from GNSS is then matched with the absolute TEC from GIM at a given location. The difference between the GNSS TEC and GIM TEC will be used to estimate the TEC bias. This study used GNSS raw data from selected six IGS stations across different latitudes in 120°E longitude sector during five most quiet and five most disturbed days for every month of 2015. This is to evaluate the performance of the proposed method that will be used for non-IGS stations across different latitudes, month, and geomagnetic activity. Correlation results show that the proposed method is strongly correlated (R > 0.990) with the standard method of calculating absolute TEC using the DCBs from IGS. The monthly absolute mean differences and root mean square differences (RMSD) are both < 7 TECU, respectively. It is also observed that the absolute mean differences and RMSDs are higher for stations in the low-latitude and equatorial regions. This is due to the high TEC gradients in these regions. For example, PIMO has the highest yearly mean difference (2.7 TECU) and RMSD (3.1) for both quiet and disturbed days while (insert stations statistics). This shows that the proposed method can provide a reliable result in calculating TEC regardless of the station's latitude, month, and geomagnetic activity.",SCOPUS_ID:85078026746,A Method in Determining Ionospheric Total Electron Content Using GNSS Data for non-IGS Receiver Stations,2-s2.0-85078026746,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-07-01,10.1109/IconSpace.2019.8905958,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538683941'}]",21654301,,186-191,"International Conference on Space Science and Communication, IconSpace",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078026746,2019-July,,cp,Conference Paper

All rights reserved. K-Means clustering algorithm for machine learning enables organizations to be intuitive by making data-driven decisions and by ensuring effective HR policies and different interventions will add value to an organization. Training and development is an essential component for firms where tangible evidences manifest when employees become more engaged, motivated and committed to contribute to the success of organizations. An assessment of an employee KSAOs needs through k-means clustering to make inferences by grouping similar data to discover underlying patterns to determine the actual deficiencies in the Achievement Category, Leadership Category and Behavior Category to minimize or totally eliminate the human errors that occurs during evaluations. A raw data of 100 employees were evaluated and profiled to determine the proper trainings needed by identifying the skill gaps of individuals.

The frequent usage of sensory modalities for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and in some In-Vehicles Information System (IVIS) are only for visuals and hearing applications. Yet, the air quality inside the car is not usually monitored. Not to mention, the existing breath analyzers are used only by road traffic police enforcer randomly in examining the alcohol content in motorist’s breath to avoid drunk driving related accidents. In this study, we proposed the development and utilization of an e-nose sensory module as an added feature for Controller Area Network (CAN) technology application. An electronic nose is characterized by its capability to intelligently sensed the gases present in the surrounding using an array of gas sensors with a pattern reorganization component. This e-nose comprises of a sensor array of five commercially available sensors (TG 2602, TG 822, TG 825, TG 813 and TG 880), a data acquisition interface, and a microprocessor. A software from the CAN module verified the system functionality. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system is able to identify the five different types of gases namely methane, ethanol, propone, isobutane, and hydrogen with high efficiency. Thus, it can be used as an added safety feature for vehicles.",SCOPUS_ID:85073363836,Utilization of e-nose sensory modality as add-on feature for advanced driver assistance system,2-s2.0-85073363836,UP,undefined,University of the Philippines,1,True,,Journal,2019-07-01,10.30534/ijatcse/2019/109842019,,,4,1783-1788,International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073363836,8,,ar,Article

Publication rights licensed to ACM. Parallel corpus is a critical resource in machine learning based translation. The task of collecting, extracting, and aligning texts in order to build an acceptable corpus for doing translation is very tedious most especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we present the efforts made to build a parallel corpus for Cebuano and Filipino from two different domains: biblical texts and the web. For the biblical resource, subword unit translation for verbs and copy-able approach for nouns were applied to correct inconsistencies in translation. This correction mechanism was applied as a preprocessing technique. On the other hand, for Wikipedia being the main web resource, commonly occurring topic segments were extracted from both the source and the target languages. These observed topic segments are unique in 4 different categories. The identification of these topic segments may be used for automatic extraction of sentences. A Recurrent Neural Network was used to implement the translation using OpenNMT sequence modeling tool in TensorFlow. The two different corpora were then evaluated by using them as two separate inputs in the neural network.

,MDA framework | Mobile game aesthetics | Mobile game motivations | Self determination theory,0,Fabito B.,"© 2019 Association of Computing Machinery. The Mobile Gaming Industry in the Philippines is expected to earn a total revenue of US$85M for 2019 and would continue to grow for as much as US$135M for 2023. Currently, the Philippines is ranked #26 in the Global Revenue Ranking for mobile games. Given this rapid and sustained growth, this may provide opportunities for local game developers to develop mobile games that can compete with known international game studios. To do this, it is essential that motivations of Filipino game players be identified. Though there are studies that have been made to uncover the motivations of mobile game use, it also revealed different claims. For this paper, it is the role of the study to determine the disparity by discovering the various game aesthetics of the five (5) Philippine top-ranking mobile games and how it is associated to the Self Determination Theory’s Psychological Motivations and Game Continuance. Nine (9) Game Aesthetics were used to determine the gameplay experience while the Gaming Motivation Scale (GAMS) was used to assess the players’ Psychological Motivations. A total of 210 respondents answered the online survey in one university in the Philippines and other Facebook groups for mobile games. Cronbach Alpha yielded a strong coefficient α = 0.872 based on the on over-all responses. Results show that the game aesthetics that are experienced by mobile players vary from one game to another. It also shows that the psychological motivations of SDT have a moderate positive relationship to Game Continuance.

Drawbacks of industrially-used fructosyltransferases (FTs) such as low optimum temperature and low fructooligosaccharides (FOS) yield necessitates the search for engineered FTs that are highly thermostable and active. With the availability of the first plant FT crystal structure from Pachysandra terminalis (PDB ID: 3UGH), computer-aided protein engineering of plant FT is now feasible. To obtain insights on the effect of specific mutations i.e. disulfide bridge introduction, wild-type and mutant FTs were subjected to a 15 μs Martini Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) simulations at 303 K and 334 K. We report here the five mutants, M31C-Q49C, L144C-S193C, P34C-W300C, S219C-L226C and V470C-S498C with enhanced thermostabilities and/or activities relative to the wild type. Interestingly, M31C-Q49C, which is located within the catalytic-carrying blade of the catalytic domain, has an activity enhancement at both temperatures. At 334 K, three mutations, L144C-S193C, P34C-W300C and V470C-S498C, achieved thermostability relative to the wild type. Intriguingly, both activity and stability enhancement exhibited only at 334 K can be achieved provided that the mutation is located either on the catalytic-carrying residue blade of the catalytic domain or on the non-catalytic domain.

A shift in power system control paradigm from centralized to a distributed framework has been evident for the past years. With the adoption of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the grid and the formation of the concept of microgrid (MG) that is now extended to the cooperation of multiple MGs to form Multi-Microgrid (MMG) systems, a distributed control framework has deemed to be more feasible for such systems. However, distributed control relies heavily on communication to achieve the system objective that in reality is not perfect at all times. In this paper, a fully distributed AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) control algorithm with resilience from failure of communication infrastructure is presented. In the algorithm, missing parameters are estimated using time-series estimation methods and an additional control layer is added to ensure supply-demand balance in the system. The algorithm was tested in different network configurations of a MMG system with different degrees of communication failure and the results show that using the control algorithm, the system was able to achieve supply-demand balance at the least possible cost of generation.",SCOPUS_ID:85076114399,Distributed AC Optimal Power Flow with Resilience from Communication Failure in MMG Systems,2-s2.0-85076114399,PCARI,undefined,Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-06-01,10.1109/ICSGSC.2019.00011,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728138480'}]",,,211-216,"Proceedings - 2019 3rd International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, ICSGSC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076114399,,,cp,Conference Paper

Blood type can be determined by the presence or absence of antigens in the red blood cells, and can be classified by the ABO (A, B, AB, O) and Rh D (either positive or negative) systems. Knowing one's blood type is one of the most crucial steps before blood transfusion or any medical operations to prevent the risk of receiving incompatible blood that could lead to adverse or even fatal reactions to patients. Although fully automated blood testing instruments are already being used in some major hospitals, its large size and long processing time, limit its ability to be used in emergency situations. Hence, during onsite blood typing, the traditional or the slide method is being used, which is less accurate due to human errors. This paper presents a raspberry pi based image processing system that is capable of determining all eight types of blood using Canny Edge and Contour Detection. All blood types detected by the proposed system matched that of the known blood samples for the controlled testing of all five samples with five trials each sample for the known A+, B+ AB+, O+, A-, B-, AB- and O-. Uncontrolled testing was also performed to compare the results of the ten random blood types identified by the proposed prototype to the results obtained from test tube method. All these ten samples matched the results obtained from the clinical laboratory.

Local alcoholic beverages such as ""Lambanog"" or Coconut wine started in 15th century and has been passed down through generations by coconut farmers garnering acceptance from global wine connoisseurs because of its sweet pungent smell, clean taste, smooth and long finish. Commercialization of local coconut wine increases the production of adulterated liquors that sets risks for the local distillery industry as well as the consumers' health. Examples of health risks include blindness, nausea and in some cases death. In this paper, the percentage of methanol as well as other compounds: Ethanol and Ethylene Glycol was able to obtain from a Near Infrared (NIR) spectrometer using a camera that captures the spectrum that passed through a sample, sends the data to a Raspberry Pi 3b which contains a software based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to classify the samples by their unique wavelength range and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) to further classify them into adulteration percentages.

8906587,clustering | distributed energy resource | planning | power energy system | representative day selection,0,Guerrero R.,"© 2019 IEEE. The proliferation of sensors and measurement devices has provided information for the planning and operation of distributed energy resources (DERs). Year-round profiles of electricity demand and renewable energy sources show the variation of these parameters. Clustering can be used to identify representative days to capture this variability as applied to finding the optimal sizes of the DERs. In this work, groups of representative days were generated out of the combinations of options during the pre-and post-processing of the clustering algorithm. An additional option is presented such that the comparison of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the representative days and all days serves as a criterion in selecting the representative days. Comparison is implemented through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To evaluate this additional option, the groups of representative days were used to generate DER designs through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based microgrid model. Simulation on these design using all days of load and meteorological data instead of the representative days computed for the respective net present cost and the load-notserved. The clustering options that effectively capture variability were determined by comparing these techno-economics to those defined in the MILP-based model. Results show that the inclusion of the CDF as a criterion improves the load-not-served. The optimal design that has the lowest net present cost was also found through this criterion.",SCOPUS_ID:85076098961,Representative Day Selection using Clustering for Distributed Energy Resource Planning,2-s2.0-85076098961,PCARI,undefined,Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-06-01,10.1109/ICSGSC.2019.000-3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728138480'}]",,,151-157,"Proceedings - 2019 3rd International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities, ICSGSC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076098961,,,cp,Conference Paper

8793433,Car Battery | Discharge | Electrolytes | Jump Start | Monitoring,0,Carpio J.,"© 2019 IEEE. The Car Battery in the Philippines can only last for an average span of 6 to 12 months. When a battery hits the 6 months margin, it will start showing unwanted responses such as unstable start up and quick discharge. These responses must be avoided specially in times that the car is significantly needed to be in good condition, such as during an emergency or a long drive. It is an inconceivable scenario to be stuck in a place far from people. As a solution, the proponents designed a device that can automatically checked for the temperature, load current, voltage level, number of hours left before reaching critical voltage level and state of charge of a car battery via wireless technology in a real time manner using a mobile application with a dedicated storage for recording data every given period. The recording interval can be adjusted to what is desired by the user. Furthermore, Algorithms on statistically analyzing the recorded data is executed by the device itself which will be a helpful information on what preventive actions the user must do to improve the performance of its car battery and therefore, avoid further problems. Also, the device uses a state estimation in achieving an almost zero steady state error of the parameters of the battery stated above that cannot be measured by a sensor such as the state of charge (SOC) and remaining battery hours. After several testing and validation, it was found that the device where able to accurately predict the level of the parameters at a plus or minus 0.38% error. Moreover, the feature of this device was made more interesting by adding a flexibility on its mean to communicate wirelessly. The system (the device and the mobile app) communicates using GSM, internet and bluetooth to increase its reliability. The user therefore has the options to manually or remotely switch loads in the vehicle. If in the event that the communication is loss, and the vehicle is approaching critical level, the device can be set to an 'auto-off' mode which automatically switch the loads off. There are instances that the loads is intended to be turned on purposively. This is why the user is given the option to enable this mode or not. Most importantly, the device is tied up with a spare battery that is intended to be used for emergency jump start. Thus, keeping an eye on the status of this spare battery is executed also on a regular interval.",SCOPUS_ID:85071440845,Real-Time Monitoring Device for Car Battery with Remote Switching Capability Via Mobile Application,2-s2.0-85071440845,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-06-01,10.1109/ITC-CSCC.2019.8793433,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728132716'}]",,,,"34th International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers and Communications, ITC-CSCC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071440845,,,cp,Conference Paper

,Data mining | Decision tree | Dropout | Rule-based,0,Timbal M.,"© 2019 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology. The advancement of the country is exceptionally reliant on the education of its citizens, which is an incontestable truth of the worldwide perspective. Education assumes a focal part of developing an individual to become a productive citizen and is the most important factor contributing to the progress of the nation. However, children in developing countries have denied their right to education by dropping out for different reasons. Student-At-Risk of Dropping Out commonly known as SARDO is a term coined by the Philippines' Department of Education, defined as, a student who is likely to become a candidate to drop out. Philippine Statistics Authority had conferred that there is a total of 36, 238 people ages from six to twenty-four who are out-of-school. This poses a predicament if this will continue without even attempting to intervene or at least reduce it gradually, to the governing body (DepEd) and ripple its effect to the entire country. In this paper, a classification data mining technique such as decision tree was used to generate a rule-based classifier. Based on results, there were three extracted rules from the decision tree generated using partykit and rpart libraries as a predictive model, a basis for forecasting who among the enrolled students will be a dropout. The first rule is, if a student has an experience being retained from previous grade level/s, he/she is more likely to drop. The second is, if he/she has not experienced retention but his/her number of siblings is greater than six, most probably he/she will drop from school. The last rule is if a student has not experienced retention nor has greater than six siblings, but his/her general average of previous grade level is fairly satisfactory and satisfactory, then he/she will probably stop from schooling. Having this intelligent predictive model, the educational institution with its stakeholders can now have a proactive measure on addressing to reduce the inflation of dropout rate of which is the sole purpose of why this study was conducted.",SCOPUS_ID:85067014512,Analysis of Student-at-Risk of Dropping out (SARDO) Using decision tree: An Intelligent predictive model for reduction,2-s2.0-85067014512,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-06-01,10.18178/ijmlc.2019.9.3.798,,,3,273-278,International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067014512,9,,ar,Article

Enhanced terahertz (THz) radiation was generated from a gallium arsenide thin film integrated on top of porous silicon distributed Bragg reflector (GaAs/PSi DBR). The film's thickness was designed to be less than the penetration depth of the 800 nm excitation source, while the PSi DBR was centered at the laser wavelength to reflect the transmitted photons at the film-substrate interface. Reflection-geometry THz time-domain spectroscopy measurement revealed enhancement in THz peak to peak amplitude by 1.67 and 5.7 times as compared to the same thickness of GaAs on silicon (GaAs/Si) and bulk semi-insulating (SI) GaAs, respectively. In comparison with the bulk SI-GaAs, both thin film samples showed an order of magnitude improvement in the THz output power. The excitation-wavelength study also revealed a maximum increase near the design wavelength. The enhancement was attributed to the high reflectivity at the film-substrate interface and optical cavity effect in GaAs.

In LTE system, each UE derives its master key after a mutual authentication is performed between the UE and its local LTE network. In this paper, two end-to-end UEs use their own master keys to generate real-time packet keys where different packet keys are applied to encrypt packet stream data on a packet basis. Because the life cycle of the packet key is same as a packet period, the proposed security scheme significantly improves the security strength for end-to-end LTE users.

Parametric oscillation in Kerr resonators with correctly engineered higher-order dispersion permits the generation of parametric sidebands with large frequency shifts [1,2]. Such devices have recently been demonstrated in MgF2 micro-disks [3], and silica microspheres [4], with sideband detunings in excess of 50 THz observed. To date, only wideband discrete tunability of the output sidebands has been reported [4]. In this contribution, we demonstrate that continuous sideband tunability is also possible by scanning the detuning of the pump laser across a single cavity mode. We present high-resolution experimental measurements with over 10 GHz of continuous tunability for a pair of parametric sidebands in an MgF2 micro-disk. This large continuous tuning range is enabled by the thermal shift of the resonator's modes as the pump is brought into resonance [5].",SCOPUS_ID:85074632719,Continuous tunability of a microresonator parametric oscillator,2-s2.0-85074632719,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-06-01,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872580,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728104690'}]",,,,"2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe and European Quantum Electronics Conference, CLEO/Europe-EQEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074632719,,,cp,Conference Paper

In Kerr microresonators, most attention to date has focussed on their ability to generate coherent optical frequency combs [1]. However, it is well known from the field of nonlinear fiber optics that parametric oscillation in Kerr cavities that exhibit higher-order dispersion can also produce single pairs of phasematched parametric sidebands at very large detunings from the original pump frequency [2,3]. Recent experiments in both MgF2 and silica microresonators have succeeded in demonstrating this effect [4,5]. However, only limited tunability has been achieved so far due to material or resonator characteristics. In this contribution, we present a set of three MgF2 microresonators, each with a carefully engineered dispersion profile, that allow for wideband parametric oscillation with a total output tuning range in excess of an octave.

,Bed transfer | Ergonomic design | Post stroke patient | Wheelchair bed,0,Gumasing M.,"© 2019 ACM. This paper aims to redesign the existing hospital bed in the Philippines by developing a wheelchair bed for bed transfer of patients with Cerebro Vascular Disease. According to National Statistics Office (NSO), Cerebro Vascular Disease, popularly known as ""stroke"" ranked fourth in the top ten causes of death in the Philippines (PSA, 2016). Because of this, the researchers come up with the study of developing an assistive device for both patients and nurses who handle and facilitate this type of patients. The study focuses only on post- stroke patients who are in recovery and rehabilitation stage which are called ""post-stroke patients"". The disability of post-stroke patients causes them to be dependent on their nurses or caregivers. According to studies, nurses and caregivers are exposed to risk of musculoskeletal disorders due to manual lifting and handling of patients especially during bed transfer. Data shows that 78% of nurses and caregivers experience pain and discomfort in their back and upper extremities due to manual lifting and poor working posture when handling patients. For these reason, it became the interest of the researchers to redesign a wheelchair bed for bed transfer of post stroke patients in order to reduce the risk of nurses and caregivers to develop musculoskeletal disorders. Principles of ergonomics are used to come up with the dimensions of the proposed product based on the anthropometric measurements of the target users. Value analysis and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool are also used to identify the technicalities of the product based from the users' requirements. Using all these tools, the researchers came up with the proposed product design of the wheelchair bed. The proposed design includes elevating bed frame into the medically required angles of elevation while the patient is at bed in three different positions.

,Deep Learning | Long-Short-Term-Memory | Machine Learning | Recurrent Neural Networks | Stock Trading,0,Torralba E.,"© 2019 ACM. Stocks prices follow the Brownian motion process that moves in a random and erratic state making it impossible to determine the future price based on the historical performance of the stock. However, the availability of the historical data of stock prices can't be ignored as it might hold hidden patterns that manifest the behavior of investors as well as the market sentiments and political conditions. Thus, investors have adapted mathematical models of regression and neural network analysis to process the stock's historical data along with the traditional fundamental analysis in forecasting the trend of stock prices. Neural network models have changed the landscape of formulating informed decisions on how investors can minimize their risks on their investments. However, deep learning models are dependent on the different hyper-parameters such as epochs, number of nodes in hidden layers, and number of hidden layers in order to produce the best trend prediction model as applied in stock investments. Unfortunately, the available literature and empirical studies are limited specifically on the number of hidden layers of deep learning models. This study attempts to explore the appropriate number of hidden layers to optimize the accuracy of a trend prediction model in stock trading.",SCOPUS_ID:85070942055,Development of a deep learning-LSTM trend prediction model of stock prices,2-s2.0-85070942055,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-05-24,10.1145/3335550.3335585,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450362641'}]",,,126-133,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070942055,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Breastfeeding chair | Ergonomic design | Filipino mothers,0,Gumasing M.,"© 2019 ACM. This paper aims to design and develop an ergonomic breastfeeding chair that will be more comfortable and suitable for breastfeeding mothers by promoting an improved posture during breastfeeding and would decrease the risk of mothers for musculoskeletal disorders. According to the report from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2010), breastfeeding mothers experience pain in neck, lower back, face and jaw due to prolonged sitting and awkward posture during breastfeeding. Mothers unconsciously slouch into positions that stress their joints, ligaments and muscles. They are also exposed to lifting force due to carrying of infants during breastfeeding. This posture aggravates painful muscle spasms and could lead to injury. Given these conditions, the researchers intend to design a breastfeeding chair for Filipino mothers using ergonomic intervention. Principles of anthropometry are used to come up with the dimensions of the proposed design based on the anthropometric measurements of the target users. Value analysis and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool are also used to identify the technicalities of the product based from the users' requirements. The proposed breastfeeding chair consists of a headrest, backrest, armrest with pulling arc handle, seat cushion and a 2-position locking foot stool. This ergonomic breastfeeding chair will not only provide comfort to the mothers but will also provide safe environment to the infants.

Electronic medical records (EMR) in general provide significant benefits to healthcare organizations and clinicians. However, a major challenge of clinicians who use EMRs is the lowered perceived quality of patient-doctor communication and interaction as a result of doctors being distracted with EMR use during consultations. A unique approach to this problem is through applications that automatically document clinical encounters in real-time. This study aims to develop a speech transcriber plugin for a web-based EMR for real-time clinical encounter documentation. We make use of available speech-to-text services on the web as well as cTAKES for clinical annotation. A draft summary of the clinical encounter is presented to the user in editable SOAP format. Blockchain technology for the speech recording is also explored to secure access to the recording.

8718140,constrained sensor devices | Quality of Service | Software Defined Networks | traffic management | Value-based Utility,0,Alipio M.,"© 2019 IEEE. Transmission of data among constrained wireless sensor devices is critical due to its limited resources such as power, bandwidth, memory, and processing. These data, generated from sensing different physical events with diverse traffic types, have to reach their destinations with a specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. With the increasing usage of sensors in the various Internet of Things applications, there is a need to address the resource allocation for handling these critical data while satisfying their respective QoS requirements. In this work, we implemented a Value-based Utility traffic management mechanism using Software Defined Networking (SDN) to cope with QoS requirement in constrained sensor devices. The SDN-enabled mechanism ensures that the demands of sensor data are satisfied by managing traffic while allocating queue resources among flows through a centralized controller, which utilizes network packet statistics. We evaluated the performance of the proposed mechanism in a simple and low-cost OpenFlow testbed with various sensor devices having different QoS requirements. Results show that each wireless sensor device achieved the level of satisfaction based on their required resource network utility.",SCOPUS_ID:85066745533,SDN-Enabled Value-Based Traffic Management Mechanism in Resource-Constrained Sensor Devices,2-s2.0-85066745533,City,undefined,"City, University of London",0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-05-17,10.1109/ICOIN.2019.8718140,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538683507'}]",19767684,,248-253,International Conference on Information Networking,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066745533,2019-January,,cp,Conference Paper

Several studies on the improvement of distribution system technologies have surfaced over the past decades. Simple and inexpensive system-based methods to improve voltage profile and minimize losses include balancing, reconfiguration, and equipment penetration. However, improper re-phasing and placement may even worsen system operations. In this paper, optimal phase reconfiguration and capacitor placement is implemented. With the component object model (COM) interface, genetic algorithm (GA) through MATLAB toolbox was used simultaneously with an open-source load flow analyzer, OpenDSS, to gather optimal outcomes. Different treatments were applied to the highly unbalanced IEEE 13-bus test radial distribution system. Results showed that each treatment yielded a significantly lower system loss than the original network. Individually, the load re-phasing approach arrived at a more efficient system than the capacitor placement approach. Still, the combination of both methods yielded the best results out of all the cases.

8711432,deep neural network | N-gram | natural language processing | text mining,0,Abrigo A.,"© 2019 IEEE. The increasing use of social media platform like Twitter provides opportunity for information dissemination to the public. The Dengvaxia controversy in the Philippines negatively affected the public's perception towards vaccination. It has been noted that due to this incident, many parents have decided not to have their children vaccinated due to fear of endangering them [2]. This resulted to children contracting other diseases like measles due to the lack of immunization [1] [2]. The preference to not have newborns undergo vaccination program remains a threat to public health. Using publicly accessible tweets, this study aims to understand health perceptions of the public in relation to Dengvaxia.

,Classification models | Educational data mining | Prediction,0,Amazona M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. This paper presents the outcomes of linking an educational data mining approach to model students' academic performance. Three data mining classification models (Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Deep Learning in Neural Network) were defined to analyze data set and to predict students' performance. The forecast presentation of the three classifiers were calculated and matched. Students' academic histories and data from the Registrar's Office were used to train the models. Results show that Deep Learning classifier beats other two classifiers by gaining the overall forecast accuracy of 95%. These results highlight the impact on student success while pointing to several promising directions for future work.

,Advanced driver-assistance system | Driving | Navigation applications | Navigation behavior | Recommender systems,1,Samson B.,"© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Navigation applications are becoming ubiquitous in our daily navigation experiences. With the intention to circumnavigate congested roads, their route guidance always follows the basic assumption that drivers always want the fastest route. However, it is unclear how their recommendations are followed and what factors affect their adoption. We present the results of a semi-structured qualitative study with 17 drivers, mostly from the Philippines and Japan. We recorded their daily commutes and occasional trips, and inquired into their navigation practices, route choices and on-the-fly decision-making. We found that while drivers choose a recommended route in urgent situations, many still preferred to follow familiar routes. Drivers deviated because of a recommendation’s use of unfamiliar roads, lack of local context, perceived driving unsuitability, and inconsistencies with realized navigation experiences. Our findings and implications emphasize their personalization needs, and how the right amount of algorithmic sophistication can encourage behavioral adaptation.",SCOPUS_ID:85067605643,Exploring factors that influence connected drivers to (not) use or follow recommended optimal routes,2-s2.0-85067605643,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-05-02,10.1145/3290605.3300601,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450359702'}]",,,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067605643,,,cp,Conference Paper

Breast cancer is the more prevalent form of cancer among women, and the most common type of breast cancer is the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Accurate identification and categorization of breast cancer subtypes have major importance in clinical tasks, and automated approaches are relevant in saving time and reducing error. Deep learning has been applied to several breast cancer detection tasks. It outperformed traditional approaches that include handcrafted features for data representation and machine learning methods for learning task. In this paper, we develop a deep learning architecture for the prediction of IDC. This study trained an improved CNN network and investigated the performance of the model on the IDC patch-based classification task. Experimental results show that our approach yields the best performance on the IDC dataset when compared to other published approaches.

8743539,animal agriculture analytics | ARIMA | bull services | data mining | Time series forecasting,0,Rola J.,"© 2019 IEEE. Resource optimization is one of the keys in achieving established organization objectives. In making concrete goals, forecasting can be used. Forecasting the near future's number of bull services (i.e. natural mating with a male purebred dairy-type carabao or technically known as carabull) may help the Philippine Carabao Center-Visayas State University (PCC-VSU) in its resource (e.g. manpower, financial, animal) target setting. This can assist in formulating livestock development plan in the genetic improvement program of PCC-VSU necessary to uplift the Philippine carabao industry; thus, can help to improve the lives of the farmers especially the smallholder carabao raisers. This study implemented a bull services Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) timeseries forecasting which is one of the advanced forecasting models used to predict trend for the next few years. An appropriate ARIMA model was selected from the analyzed bull services data from 2002 to 2014. Data from 2015 to 2017 were utilized as testing data and bull services for 2019 to 2021 were predicted as well. The results show that the ARIMA forecast are better than the existing annual target setting method used by the center. The model predicted values are generally closer to the actual number of bull services than the center's targeted values. In terms of Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), ARIMA scored 3.31.

This paper is directed towards the development of an improved HCDC(k) to minimize the possibility of inflation. An improved adaptive hamming code data compression has been developed by reducing the number of bits used when substituting a non-valid codeword. The proposed algorithm is expected to provide greater compression ratio, space savings, and compression speed. It is also expected to minimize the possibility of inflation when compressing random texts. To evaluate the efficiency of the modified algorithm, simulations were conducted to compress sample texts from COCA corpus and random texts using the original HCDC(k) and modified HCDC(k). Compressing sample texts from COCA corpus lead to a significant difference of 7.5% in space savings and 0.11 in compression ratio. The simulation conducted with random texts lead to a significant difference of 10.45% in space savings and 0.1 in compression ratio.

Traffic congestions in urban cities unwantedly form platoons of vehicles running at low speeds. For vehicles operated by human drivers, reaction to speeding up or down requires some time, thus, increasing travel time. In this study, we present an adaptive cruise control for a group of autonomous vehicles that follow each other. We propose a taillight tracking system by utilizing low-cost dashboard cameras for detecting the position of the lead vehicle and then allow autonomous vehicles to correctly accelerate or decelerate depending on the nature of traffic. This is achieved by detecting the leading vehicle’s taillight via linear AND-ing of the the RGB and HSV color model representations.

,Axial load | Flexure | Metal furring | Wall panel,0,De La Cruz J.,"© 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. A precast concrete wall panel using metal furring as vertical reinforcement was designed and constructed. Several properties of the components of the wall panel design are tested including the aggregates, cement, reinforcements, and concrete before it was subjected to various strength tests against axial compression, flexural, and shear failures. Statistical tool was then used to test the variability of the theoretical and actual capacity of wall specimens. Study reveals that the wall design was governed by the flexural action. In addition, the theoretical axial compressive load design was much higher compared to the actual axial load capacity which signifies that the wall panel is not a load bearing structural member. The wall panel was then compared to the existing CHB wall design in terms of their cost – to – strength values to evaluate its economic viability. Study shows that the wall design is much cheaper compared to CHB wall.

,CDL netlist | Compiler | Fabric IP | FPGA | Integration | IP | Verilog netlist,0,Salem A.,"© 2019, International Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering  &  Telecommunications. Integrating fabric intellectual property (IP) netlists in field programmable gate array (FPGA) development can be very time-consuming especially if the design complexity and density increased significantly and the integration is done manually. Another issue in most integration techniques available is that it does not have a dedicated fabric IP netlists generator which makes the integration more tedious especially if there are changes and iterations needed in the design development like changing the design density. This paper introduces a fabric IP netlist generator that uses a compiler-approach to fabric integration. The compiler automatically connects the IP blocks and generates a fabric IP netlist depending on the user-input parameters. This tool provides the flexibility of changing the fabric IP array sizes and the IPs to be connected depending on the specifications required.

Among managerial researches, job satisfaction has long been acclaimed as the prime index of worker’s wellbeing as well as a core motivational construct that has key implications for organizational and administrative policy. Talking about administrative policy, some existing problems identified in every organization especially in schools and institutions are the proliferation of data and how those data will be an aid for decision making and intervention programs. To bridge the gap, research is the viewed solution. However, despite the advent of technology, there are still researchers who rely on old methods and still used predefined queries and charts. They are often unlikely to accomplish a well-established knowledge extraction from databases using the old and traditional methods.

,Blockchain | Consortium blockchain | International roaming | Non-mining consensus | Smart contracts,4,Bailon M.,"© 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. International roaming is one of the many essential services a carrier enables on its customer's subscriber identity module (SIM) cards that allows its users to send and receive calls, messages, and e-mails whenever they travel to another country. From its beginnings in voice roaming in the last 1.5 decades up to today, international roaming has been a pivotal contributor to the sales of telecommunications carriers. It does however come at a high cost, which the users end up paying, due to numerous factors such as roaming agreements between home carriers and visited carriers as well as clearinghouses needed by companies to settle disputes in agreements between the carriers involved. This paper proposes a consortium blockchain approach coupled with smart contract application. The decentralized nature of a blockchain and the automation that smart contracts provide solves two of international roaming problems—intermediaries and high cost. Together with Tendermint—a consensus mechanism that requires no mining, implementation of the consortium blockchain can be done involving all carriers around the world with them being the privileged users and verify the transactions of two engaging carriers. With this setup, the blockchain is privatized yet still able to perform the essential functions of a blockchain, which are immutability, security, and transparency of data. The proposal can eliminate the need for continually changing roaming agreements and clearing houses that increase the price for the users as well as slow down the processing time making international roaming services much more efficient, user-friendly and cost-effective for both its consumers and carriers.",SCOPUS_ID:85068799598,International roaming services optimization using private blockchain and smart contracts,2-s2.0-85068799598,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-05-01,10.30534/ijatcse/2019/32832019,,,3,544-550,International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068799598,8,,ar,Article

It will automatically make a sound to alarm the people inside the house, some home systems have a built-in sprinkler that work when the fire alarm activates preventing further property destruction. There are a lot of ways of designing a home control system but at these times, the design must be adaptable and adaptive to most people. Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is a means of wireless communication between people. It can also be used to communicate with devices such that it functions even if a user is not physically present in the vicinity of the device. GSM is the most adaptable medium since it has a further range of communication compared to Bluetooth and infrared. Moreover, it is also more accessible than Wi-Fi since it is more widely available. A home monitoring system interfaced with GSM poses a great advantage and convenience to the public. The user can be updated regarding the status (ON or OFF) of his appliances which can prevent future damage. It will also be able to alarm the user of any irregular activities of the appliances immediately even if the user is at another place.",SCOPUS_ID:85068792038,Mobile phone graphical user interface (GUI) for appliance remote control: An SMS-based electronic appliance monitoring and control system,2-s2.0-85068792038,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-05-01,10.30534/ijatcse/2019/23832019,,,3,487-494,International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068792038,8,,ar,Article

We further study the variability in the verbal interaction between different performance groups. Towards this goal, we extract topics representing the content of meetings as well as term-frequencies of items that play a critical role in the decision task. We use a dataset where each group performs the winter survival task, in which the task is to decide on the ranking of different items with respect to the importance of each item for their survival. In the experiments, we contrast the ranking of items with respect to their term frequencies and compare the differences between topics both for distinct personality traits and group performances. Results of the term-frequency based approach show that influential people put correct emphasis on items more than dominant people. The topic-based method reveals that influential people consider the majority of items by providing usage instructions for alternative scenarios and that dominant people focus only on a small subset of items by stressing their significance. High-performance groups assess items in a similar manner to influential and dominant people, i.e. a wide range of items are considered and their importance is explained. Low-performance groups, on the other hand, concentrate on the situation they are in rather than the items and their usages.",SCOPUS_ID:85070457456,Analyzing group performance in small group interaction: Linking personality traits and group performance through the verbal content,2-s2.0-85070457456,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-05-01,10.1109/FG.2019.8756531,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728100890'}]",,,,"Proceedings - 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FG 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070457456,,,cp,Conference Paper

,Dimension reduction | Gaussian–Hermite integration | Optimization | Pearson system | Reliability,1,Liao K.,"© 2019 The computational cost of an optimization considering probabilistic constraints is often expensive due to the reliability analysis performed inside the optimization loop. This study computes reliability using an equivalent single variable Pearson's distribution system. To retain the accuracy without sacrificing efficiency, dimension reduction method is used to reduce the required number of points in Gaussian–Hermite integration. In addition, four advance machine learning techniques are used to construct a hyper-probability density function to solve the singularity issue in the Pearson distribution system. The ε-constrained is utilized in a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (PSO/SOS) to consider the probabilistic constraints. The proposed algorithm is verified with several literature studies. Results shown that it is able to find an optimal design for problems having linear, highly nonlinear, and implicit probabilistic constraint functions with normal or non-normal variables. It is found that increasing number of variates in dimension reduction can provide a more accurate estimation of moments of the performance functions and enhance the solution accuracy. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm to a practical problem, a platform of the SAP2000 Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) is developed to find an optimal design for a three story steel frame under nonlinear time history analysis.",SCOPUS_ID:85063037413,A heuristic optimization considering probabilistic constraints via an equivalent single variable Pearson distribution system,2-s2.0-85063037413,,MOST 105-2221-E-011-010-MY3,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",0,False,S1568494619301395,Journal,2019-05-01,10.1016/j.asoc.2019.03.021,,15684946,,670-684,Applied Soft Computing Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063037413,78,,ar,Article

Fire is a reoccurring problem in the Philippines, and is costing the government billions of pesos in property damage along with several hundred fatalities every year. Existing fire alarm systems are prone to false alarms because it relies solely on detecting smoke. Unmonitored heat and gas leakages were two of the top causes of fire incidents in previous years. Incorporating the MQ-5 and MQ-2 gas sensors with the AMG8833 thermal imaging camera will allow for an accurate fire monitoring system that is less prone to false alarms. Using the two gas sensors will allow for the monitoring of LPG, Butane, and CH4. Also method of interpolating the display of the AMG8833 from 8x8 pixels to 70x70 was developed and sensor data was sent wirelessly to ThingSpeak. The thermal camera and the gas sensors both correlated to accurately assess fire hazards. A wireless communication with the user was used on the system to shorten the time of response of the fire fighter when fire alarm is triggered. The sensors are connected wirelessly over 6LoWPAN and uses ANN (artificial neural network) for forecasting possible future sensor reading and identification.

,IPVS | QoS | SDN | Video streaming | Video surveillance,1,Go S.,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the coming years, the dominance of video in global Internet traffic is expected to intensify due to the ongoing migration from analog CCTV to IP-based surveillance systems. As opposed to analog, IP cameras can be integrated into pre-existing computer networks and thus, are more cost-effective. However, since video is bandwidth-intensive, contention among the streams from multiple IP cameras and traffic from other applications results to a severely degraded network performance. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a relatively new paradigm which aims to build dynamically configurable networks. The decoupling of forwarding and control functions in SDN architecture enables a centralized controller to create a map of the network topology by utilizing the information collected from the switches. This paper proposes an SDN-based framework to enhance the performance of IP Video Surveillance (IPVS) systems deployed over underprovisioned networks. As a means of allowing the controller to infer a stream's QoS metrics and to execute bitrate adjustment or rerouting as necessary, two video quality indicators were also formulated by utilizing the statistics messages available in OpenFlow, a widely recognized protocol in SDN. Moreover, our design is built on the idea that the video streams in surveillance systems offer different utilities depending on the captured event. Experimental results show that employing the proposed framework improved the video streams’ overall packet loss, latency, jitter and throughput by 88%, 36%, 11% and 5% respectively. The comparison of the video streams’ QoS metrics also suggests that the framework is capable of prioritizing the reception of selected streams. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be easily extended to handle the case of an IPVS system wherein the streams are subjected to dynamic priority assignment.",SCOPUS_ID:85061327989,An SDN-based framework for improving the performance of underprovisioned IP Video Surveillance networks,2-s2.0-85061327989,,undefined,Commission on Higher Education,0,False,S1084804519300402,Journal,2019-04-15,10.1016/j.jnca.2019.01.026,,10848045,,49-74,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061327989,132,,ar,Article

,,2,Lin H.,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Intramolecular singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) has been experimentally observed and reported. However, problems remain in theoretically accounting for the corresponding intramolecular electronic couplings and their rates. We used the fragment excitation difference (FED) scheme to calculate the coupling with states from restricted active-space spin-flip configuration interaction. We investigated three covalently linked pentacene dimers via a phenyl group in an ortho-, meta-, and para-arrangement. The singlet fission and TTA couplings were enhanced when two chromophores were covalently linked. With the Fermi golden rule, both the estimated singlet fission and TTA rates were in line with the experimental results. For systems with significant singlet-fission coupling, charge-transfer components were observed in the excited states involved, and charge-transfer states were also seen within 1 eV above the singlet excited states. Our approach allows for an analysis of through-bond versus through-space singlet fission in the full electronic wave functions. The FED scheme is useful for calculating intramolecular singlet-fission and TTA couplings.",SCOPUS_ID:85063477152,First Principle Prediction of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Triplet Triplet Annihilation Rates,2-s2.0-85063477152,,AS-IA-106-M01,Academia Sinica,0,False,,Journal,2019-04-09,10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01185,,15499618,4,2246-2253,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063477152,15,30860838.0,ar,Article
,Canonical variate analysis | Fault detection | Global kernel | Kernel density estimation | Local kernel,4,Pilario K.,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Incipient fault monitoring is becoming very important in large industrial plants, as the early detection of incipient faults can help avoid major plant failures. Recently, Canonical Variate Dissimilarity Analysis (CVDA) has been shown to be an efficient technique for incipient fault detection, especially under dynamic process conditions. CVDA can be extended to nonlinear processes by introducing kernel-based learning. Incipient fault monitoring requires kernels with both good interpolation and extrapolation abilities. However, conventional single kernels only exhibit one ability or the other, but not both. To overcome this drawback, this study presents a Mixed Kernel CVDA method for incipient fault monitoring in nonlinear dynamic processes.

The study introduces a new pooling scheme called Accept-Reject Pooling which uses a stochastic procedure and integration of a rejection sampling based method of selection from a multinomial distribution of the pooling region's activations. The stochastic component of the proposed pooling operation ensures that non-maximal activations will have a chance to be selected and passed to the network while ensuring that the strong activations get the higher chance of being sampled. Experiments demonstrate that the approach can also work well with other techniques such as Batch Normalization and Data Augmentation Convolutional Neural Network achieve improved performance with Accept-Reject Pooling as compared to the use of several pooling methods such as max, stochastic and mixed pooling on benchmark image classification datasets.",SCOPUS_ID:85073167125,An improved pooling scheme for convolutional neural networks,2-s2.0-85073167125,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-04-01,10.1109/ICICN.2019.8834960,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728104263'}]",,,201-206,"2019 7th International Conference on Information, Communication and Networks, ICICN 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073167125,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Construction project management | Factor analysis | Mathematical model | Project cost,0,Cabuñas J.,"©BEIESP. Adapting innovations in construction project management can proliferate the production of high-quality projects which are known as vital contributors to the socio-economic development of a country. This study was conducted to provide a new approach to cost estimation that would help prevent cost overrun problem during project implementation. Preliminary data collection through literature review and interview led to the determination of qualitative information pertaining to the most frequently encountered cost-influencing conditions and issues, which were adopted to develop the Cost-influencing Factor Assessment Questionnaire, following an Exploratory Factor Analysis through Principal Axis Factoring Method and Oblique Promax Rotation Method to uncover the latent underlying cost-influencing factors for building projects. The survey data were validated through the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO>0.5) and the Bartlett test of sphericity (p<0.05), which indicate the suitability of the data for Factor Analysis. Scree Plot Analysis and Parallel Analysis suggested that 9 factors should be extracted, which were then named according to the shared concepts of the items clustered under each factor. After extensive data screening and analysis, the validity and reliability requirements for scale construction were met, and a new set of items categorized into 9 cost-influencing factors were obtained, establishing the Project Cost Assessment Instrument. A mathematical model was developed through multiple linear regression analysis which showed that 4 out of 9 factors were significant predictors for residential project cost, and these were Project Scale, Equipment Management, Site Condition, and Client Collaboration. The validity of the model was ascertained by means of graphical and mathematical validation, proving the mathematical model’s good prediction accuracy.",SCOPUS_ID:85070658919,Exploratory factor-item analytic approach for construction project cost overrun using oblique promax rotation for predictors determination,2-s2.0-85070658919,CERD,undefined,Centre for Engineering Research and Development,0,False,,Journal,2019-04-01,,,,6,47-54,International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070658919,8,,ar,Article

Monitoring of students’ academic performance is one of the main topics of educational data mining especially if a given course has a licensure examination¬. In the Philippines, licensure examination is one serious aspect in the field of education. However, still very few researches have been carried out concerning predictions of licensure examination performance. Most researches focus on academic retentions and developing dropout models. With this, the study is aimed to extract predictive model using Decision Tree Algorithm. The study aims to compare the performance of the decision tree growing methods in predicting student licensure examination using Confusion Matrix Test. These methods consist of Chisquared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), Classification and Regression Trees (CRT) and Quick and Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST).

Tele-medicine systems run the risk of unauthorized access to medical records, and there is greater possibility for the unlawful sharing of sensitive patient information, including children, and possibly showing their private parts. Aside from violating their right to privacy, such practices discourage patients from subjecting themselves to tele-medicine. The authors thus present an automatic identity concealment system for pictures, the way it is designed in the GetBetter tele-medicine system developed under a WHO/TDR grant. Based on open-source face- and eye-detection algorithms, identity concealment is executed by blurring the eye region of a detected face using pixel shuffling. This method is shown to be not only effective in concealing the identity of the patient, but also in preserving the exact distribution of pixel values in the image. This is useful when subsequent image processing techniques are employed, such as when identifying the type of lesions based on images of the skin.",SCOPUS_ID:85062940684,Identity concealment when uploading pictures of patients in a tele-medicine system,2-s2.0-85062940684,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-04-01,10.4018/IJEHMC.2019040103,,1947315X,2,44-62,International Journal of E-Health and Medical Communications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062940684,10,,ar,Article

Events are the most important bits of information that should be delivered timely wherever the person is. It is but equally important that a person must have the ability to keep abreast with the recent trends of technology in order to be notified of the important events that need to be addressed or responded immediately. Sometimes, notification of events is given in a short period of time, which sometimes leads to failure in attending or responding such events. In today’s generation, smartphones are always and almost available to every individual, with which one of its most important features is notification. It is under this premise that prompted the researchers to develop an Android-based ubiquitous notification app for Bukidnon State University (BukSU) to speed up the dissemination of information about the upcoming events and activities of the university. The University Administrators will act as an admin in order to input and update the list of activities or events for the entire academic year which is either planned, unplanned, routine or emergency in nature. The faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders will act as a user and will be notified of the academic activities. A Waterfall Model was used in the design process and Android studio in the development of the application. As a result, the system was tested in terms of its functionality, applicability, relevance, and usability. The overall result has a mean of 4.736 which indicates that the respondents are very satisfied with the mobile application.

In the near future, Intelligent Transportation Systems will integrate autonomous vehicles and roadside infrastructures in the current urban road setup to collect environment data and then disseminate the information to surrounding vehicles for road safety, traffic convenience, and travel comfort. Autonomous vehicles, individually, can perform traffic-specific tasks to accomplish certain objectives, such as exploring for unknown or unmapped road sections and searching for road accidents. In this work, a cooperative search algorithm based on behavioral rules are used to direct PBOT (no acronym definition) mobile robots to cooperatively search road accidents in the city. The PBOTs, emulating autonomous vehicles, follow a hierarchical set of behavioral rules to achieve a cooperative search and uses the cellular network for communication and data exchange among PBOTs. PBOTs are programmed to follow random and deterministic paths in sensing the urban grid map. Results show that deterministic paths provide lesser exploration time, but may not be realistically viable.

8743803,Consolidated Weighted Mean Approach | Empirical Taxi GPS Traces | RSU Deployment,0,Magsino E.,"© 2019 IEEE. The city infrastructure is an integral part of vehicular ad-hoc networks and intelligent transportation systems. One of the key infrastructures is the roadside unit (RSU) which can vastly improve the efficiency and coverage of data dissemination and information exchange in the vehicular network when deployed judiciously. RSU can also provide real-time traffic control, safety and road services to drivers. In this paper, we study how to strategically deploy RSUs in candidate junctions in a city layout by employing findings from taxi GPS traces such as the total daily number of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) contacts, transmissions, transmitted file size, and the average space speed. A Consolidated Weighted Mean Approach, ConsWMA, based from four practical methods for deploying RSUs, is proposed to maximize the amount of V2I contacts. We observe that these mobility traces' findings, when set as deployment criteria, can reduce the needed number of RSUs to be deployed and the missing V2I contacts. Simulation results show that when nine out of the 40 possible RSU locations are allocated in the first two rings of Beijing City, a 95% daily average V2I contacts is attained, thereby making information dissemination feasible. ConsWMA also provides at least 11% more V2I contacts when compared to two other deployment methods.",SCOPUS_ID:85069158549,Employing mobility traces' findings in deploying roadside units in an urban setup,2-s2.0-85069158549,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-04-01,10.1109/ISCAIE.2019.8743803,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538685464'}]",,,97-102,ISCAIE 2019 - 2019 IEEE Symposium on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069158549,,,cp,Conference Paper

8726896,knowledge base | mobile application | natural language processing | question answering | scheduling,0,Sanchez K.,"© 2019 IEEE. This paper provides a tool that aids users for remembering and recovering information on a mobile application, named RECall. The user can record his knowledge like schedules, medications or other information through the app and he can retrieve them by asking questions. Question answering (QA) aims to answer a natural language question. The challenge, however, is how to deal with the same questions that have different ways of expressing it. Knowledge-based question answering makes use of a knowledge base (KB) as an information source where the data is structured. Structuring the knowledge representation will be essential for generating answers later on, which is done by information extraction (IE), for a knowledge base containing logs, schedules, and medications of the user, for this study. The question answering focuses an open domain, and it uses keyword-based, synonym-based, and rule-based approaches. While, scheduling (SCH) allows adding schedule, time-based moving schedule, entity-based or time-based canceling schedule, and recording medication with calendar app integration. Given a dataset of 100 knowledge and 100 questions, the question answering evaluated about 79% accuracy for classifying correct, incorrect, and null answers out of 95 valid questions, with 53% and above precision, recall, and F-measure. Although there are more rules constructed upon resolving rules in conflict, with a solid foundation and combining other approaches, it leaves the possibility of being open to more cases. Nevertheless, the study has achieved its purpose to develop a mobile application for scheduling and question answering systems with Representational State Transfer (REST) web services.",SCOPUS_ID:85067931119,RECall: A Scheduling System and Question Answering System with User Knowledge Base on a Mobile Application for Remembering and Recovering information,2-s2.0-85067931119,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-04-01,10.1109/ICCET.2019.8726896,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728114392'}]",,,134-138,"2019 2nd International Conference on Communication Engineering and Technology, ICCET 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067931119,,,cp,Conference Paper

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Chlorella is one of the most nutritionally important microalgae with high protein content and can be a good source of potential bioactive peptides. In the current study, isolated proteins from Chlorella sorokiniana were subjected to in silico analysis to predict potential peptides with biological activities. Molecular characteristics of proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and proteomics techniques. A total of eight proteins were identified by proteomics techniques from 10 protein bands of the SDS-PAGE. The predictive result by BIOPEP’s profile of bioactive peptides tools suggested that proteins of C. sorokiniana have the highest number of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP IV) inhibitors, with high occurrence of other bioactive peptides such as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, glucose uptake stimulant, antioxidant, regulating, anti-amnestic and antithrombotic peptides. In silico analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis revealed that pepsin (pH > 2), bromelain and papain were proteases that can release relatively larger quantity of bioactive peptides. In addition, combinations of different enzymes in hydrolysis were observed to dispense higher numbers of bioactive peptides from proteins compared to using individual proteases. Results suggest the potential of protein isolated from C. sorokiniana could be a source of high value products with pharmaceutical and nutraceutical application potential.",SCOPUS_ID:85064844637,Prediction of bioactive peptides from chlorella sorokiniana proteins using proteomic techniques in combination with bioinformatics analyses,2-s2.0-85064844637,,106-2311-B-019-001,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",1,True,,Journal,2019-04-01,10.3390/ijms20071786,,16616596,7,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064844637,20,30978907.0,ar,Article

,,0,Cruz F.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. With the continuous increase in number of people suffering from diabetes, the demand of a device that can noninvasively monitor blood glucose level has been greater. The goal of the study is to develop a device that can monitor the blood glucose level that would not cause any discomfort to the patients by utilizing reflectance mode photoplethysmography equipped with a filtering technique, Moving Average filter. Initially, the device prompts the user to choose from two categories depending on his condition: diabetic or non-diabetic, and then would choose between the two modes: fasting or post meal mode. The parameters utilized in the study are the force in Newton (N) which corresponds to the applied pressure on the finger, the peak-to-peak voltage (V) of the photopletyhsmography signal, and lastly, the blood glucose level measured in milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). The force is acquired using a force sensitive resistor that is incorporated in the ring. The suggested device employs a photoplethysmography sensor which can diagnose variations on microvascular bed of tissue. The variations in the distribution of blood volume have a significant relation with the measurement of blood glucose level. The technique used to estimate the photoplethysmography in terms of peak-to-peak voltage is the Moving Average filter, and the result is then compared to that of the OneTouch glucometer and Fasting Plasma Glucose.

,Blood pressure | Body fat percentage | Hypertension | Independent component analysis | Metabolic syndrome,0,Ariones K.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Medical devices diagnose or monitor internal conditions to aid in early detection, which is a huge help in saving the lives of patients. There are underlying factors that affect a person’s body if a disease is present. These diseases may have an impact on the different parameters of the human body. The combination of high and low values of these body parameters may lead to a certain chronic disease. Some examples of chronic diseases include hypertension and metabolic syndrome. In this paper, the researchers were able to obtain the blood pressure reading by getting pulse rate and pulse transit which will be obtained from ATMega328 clock of the Gizduino Mini. The percentage of the body fat can be derived using the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis wherein an alternating current will flow between two electrodes attached to the surface of the skin to determine its corresponding impedance. The acquired data from the sensors passes through the computational technique of independent component analysis, wherein it separates the data from several sensors. There were 16 test subjects, whose ages are within the range of 55-65 years old. Confusion matrix was used in order to obtain the overall accuracy of the device. The best accuracy value is 1. The researchers obtained an accuracy value of 0.8125. By getting the absolute value of the difference of 1, 0 and the obtained value, it depicts that the obtained value is closer to 1 due to its difference of 0.2 compared to 0 which is 0.8.

,database | genomics | interoperability | rice | Web server | wheat,1,Scheben A.,"© 2018 The Author(s). Improving productivity of the staple crops wheat and rice is essential to feed the growing global population, particularly in the context of a changing climate. However, current rates of yield gain are insufficient to support the predicted population growth. New approaches are required to accelerate the breeding process, and many of these are driven by the application of large-scale crop data. To leverage the substantial volumes and types of data that can be applied for precision breeding, the wheat and rice research communities are working towards the development of integrated systems to access and standardize the dispersed, heterogeneous available data. Here, we outline the initiatives of the International Wheat Information System (WheatIS) and the International Rice Informatics Consortium (IRIC) to establish Web-based single-access systems and data mining tools to make the available resources more accessible, drive discovery and accelerate the production of new crop varieties. We discuss the progress of WheatIS and IRIC towards unifying specialized wheat and rice databases and building custom software platforms to manage and interrogate these data. Single-access crop information systems will strengthen scientific collaboration, optimize the use of public research funds and help achieve the required yield gains in the two most important global food crops.",SCOPUS_ID:85055435804,Progress in single-access information systems for wheat and rice crop improvement,2-s2.0-85055435804,ARC,undefined,Australian Research Council,0,False,,Journal,2019-03-22,10.1093/bib/bby016,,14675463,2,565-571,Briefings in Bioinformatics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055435804,20,29659709.0,ar,Article

Past research has had success in automatically generating music through learning-based agents [1] that make use of neural networks and through model and rule-based approaches [2]. These methods require a significant amount of information, either in the form of a large dataset for learning or a comprehensive set of rules based on musical concepts. This paper explores a model in which a minimal amount of musical information is needed to compose a desired style of music. This paper makes use of objectness, a concept directly derived from imagery and pattern recognition to extract specific musical objects from a single musical piece. This is then used as the foundation to produce a new generated musical piece that is similar in style to the original. The overall musical piece is generated through a partial evolution. This method eliminates the need for a large amount of pre-provided data and directly composes music based on a singular source piece.",SCOPUS_ID:85063915773,Reproducing Musicality: Detecting Musical Objects and Emulating Musicality Through Partial Evolution,2-s2.0-85063915773,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-18,10.1109/ICAIIC.2019.8669033,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538678220'}]",,,14-18,"1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication, ICAIIC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063915773,,,cp,Conference Paper

Hand gestures have been one of the oldest and natural methods of human interaction. It is considered as an interaction medium that can possibly deliver more intuitive, creative and natural method for communication between human and a machine. The researchers choose to create an android based hand gesture controlled interface system for home appliances that serves as an alternative to existing remote controllers. The camera of the android device will be used to detect static hand gestures for processing. The gathered data will be compared to a database of recognizable static hand gestures to execute commands on certain home appliances using infrared light. After series of testing and evaluation, the system is able to execute control functions to the home appliances indicated by specific hand gestures. The system required correct execution of the corresponding static gesture to properly execute the command functions of the appliances with proper lighting and illuminance for proper recognition else it would result into loss of accuracy and false detection. For the system to be able to communicate or receive information the transmission of the sender (IR) should be in line of sight to the receivers (IR) with six (6) meters range between the appliances and the mobile phone.

The trend of technology nowadays requires massive machine-to-machine communications and this can be done only through the application of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning to different devices through wireless sensor networks. One of the applications is through the development of acoustic disdrometer. Acoustic disdrometer is a tool that measures the amount of rainfall through the sound produced as the raindrops hit the piezoelectric sensors. With this, the main purpose of this study is to develop predictive models through the application of machine learning algorithms that can be used to categorize the intensity of the amount of rainfall from ambient noise. In the study, there were three machine learning algorithms that were used, namely: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors and Naïve-Bayes classifier.

Certain strains of algae yield adequate amounts of protein, and the microalgae species, Chlorococcum infusionum, is reported to have 50% protein yield which could alleviate food shortage. However, limited studies about this strain restricts its potential for food production. Furthermore, in algal protein processing, the drying process consumes large amounts of energy. This study investigated the drying characteristics of C. infusionum to analyze its drying time and drying behavior. A definitive screening design of experiment used temperatures of 40°C, 55°C, and 70°C, absolute pressures of 20 kPa, 50 kPa, and 80 kPa, and microalgae thicknesses of 3 mm, 5 mm, and 7 mm. Thin-layer specimens are placed on petri dishes for vacuum drying, and data is automatically collected using an Arduino microcontroller. Page, Modified Page, Henderson-Pabis, Two-term, and Aghbashlo models are used, and a proposed model is constructed to improve the goodness of fit of the experimental data with the mathematical model. Newton-Rhapson method was used to fit the experimental data with the mathematical models, and the coefficient of determination (>0.989), root mean square error (<2.7%), and reduced chi-square (<0.001) are computed to analyze the goodness of fit of each model. All models exhibited good fit with the experimental data, and the proposed model was verified to best represent the drying characteristics of C. infusionum based on t-tests.

8666246,Crashworthiness | Finite element analysis | Public transportation | Vehicle design,0,Rogelio J.,"© 2018 IEEE. In this study, the crashworthiness analysis of the Philippine jeepney was successfully demonstrated using the finite element analysis approach. The Philippine jeepneys, or sometimes-called jeeps, are the most popular means of public transportation in the country. They are often known in the country as 'King of the Road.' Though commuting via jeepney is the cheapest option, there are a lot of cons. Jeepneys are often mechanically unsound due to their balding tires, crabbing and yawing from distorted subframes with poor emission. The FEA Design Center Facility of the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC) of the Department of Science and Technology was able to evaluate the vehicle crashworthiness using computer-aided design (CAD) and FEA models developed in SIEMENS NX. From the simulated impact analysis results, the current jeepney design is not well designed to absorb such crash impact. Thus, resulting in fatal injuries that may cause harm to its passengers.",SCOPUS_ID:85064131880,Design of the Philippine jeepney for crashworthiness analysis: A finite element analysis approach,2-s2.0-85064131880,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666246,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064131880,,,cp,Conference Paper

8666379,Maximum PV energy generation | Sensorless tracking | Solar energy,1,Sabran R.,"© 2018 IEEE. Solar tracking systems typically uses sun pointing sensors to accurately determine the sun's position and maintain the PV panel perpendicular to the direct beam of the solar radiation to maximize energy generation. However, sun pointing sensors are ineffectual without the presence of the sun and in the strong occurrence of reflected light; and are susceptible to tracking errors due to improper installation and effects of varying weather conditions. This in turn leads to poor tracking performance which adversely affects the energy generation of PV panels. To address this weakness, a sunflower inspired solar tracking strategy that mimics the heliotropic behavior of sunflowers was developed. The scheme utilizes the light-generated current from the PV panel working in conjunction with the Real Time Clock module to infer the apparent location of the sun as it traverses the sky during daytime. The performance of the single axis sensorless prototype was assessed in terms of tracking error and energy gained. The result of the experiment conducted shows that the proposed strategy achieved an average tracking error of 0.727° under different weather conditions, while sustaining an estimated average percent power loss of 0.287%. This maximizes the available solar energy received by the PV panel by 99.7%. Thus, the sunflower inspired solar tracking strategy is able to maximize energy generation. As a result, an estimated energy gain of 20.5% over an optimally tilted fixed panel was achieved.",SCOPUS_ID:85064129930,Sunflower inspired solar tracking strategy: A sensorless approach for maximizing photovoltaic panel energy generation,2-s2.0-85064129930,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666379,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064129930,,,cp,Conference Paper
8666366,Anti-monotone | Confidence | FP-Growth | Frequent pattern | Support,0,Caroro R.,"© 2018 IEEE. Pattern discovery does not only end when a process obtained a certain pattern. It also requires careful evaluation to show whether the pattern is significant enough to support any decision-making. Generating interesting frequent pattern is important to remove uninteresting and weak rules. The study, Dual Pruned Frequent Pattern-Growth (2P FP-Growth), enhanced the FP-Growth algorithm by performing the dual pruning of the itemsets before generating frequent patterns. The 2P FP-Growth algorithm first removed the itemsets not satisfying the minimum support count, which represent the first pruning. Consequently, the algorithm constructed the FP tree. Secondly, the 2P FP-Growth traverses each subtree, removing the nodes in a subtree that do not satisfy the minimum support count, constituting the second pruning. The second pruning process used the modified anti-monotone support constraint which removes the nodes in a subtree that do not meet with the minimum support count, but not the entire subtree. The confidence measure of the resulting frequent patterns of the 2P FP-Growth showed the most interesting frequent patterns with a confidence measure of 1.0, while obtaining the interdependency result of less than 1.0. The comparative result implies that the association rule's performance is negatively interdependent to its predicted response.",SCOPUS_ID:85064129580,An enhanced frequent pattern-growth algorithm with dual pruning using modified anti-monotone support,2-s2.0-85064129580,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666366,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064129580,,,cp,Conference Paper

The study of the changes in the behaviour of the Ionosphere is of great importance due to its influence on radio propagations. Stanford University's SuperSID monitor is used to study these changes by tracking the strength of very low frequency signals over time. The purpose of this research is to setup a SuperSID monitor in Manila, Philippines using a microcomputer as the main computing device. The Data Acquisition (DAQ) system includes a loop antenna, a preamplifier, a USB sound card, and a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The system output is a SID data graph which is a plot of the relative VLF signal strength over time from NWC (19.8 kHz) and NDT (22.2 kHz) VLF transmitters. Pattern for the VLF signal strength during daytime was distinguished as more stable, compared to the fluctuations during night time. Also, the sunrise and sunset signatures were observed from the graph and were characterized as a gradual decay on VLF signal strength and as a sudden drop on VLF signal strength, respectively. To validate the signatures, it was compared to the actual civil twilight terminators over the monitor, the transmitter, and the midpoint or the center of minimum distance between the monitor (MIT-PH) and the transmitter. Based from the results, the minimum signal strengths from the SID graph correspond closely to the time when the civil twilight ends or starts over the midpoint of the monitor-transmitter pair.",SCOPUS_ID:85064123234,Development of a microcomputer-based data acquisition system for the SuperSID monitor in the Philippines,2-s2.0-85064123234,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666229,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064123234,,,cp,Conference Paper

The use of learning management systems where students can take online examinations is growing in acceptance and being adopted in the field of education. One of the major setbacks of having a web-based application in assessing the students' performance is that, it only assesses them based on the number of correct and wrong answers. It does not provide an intelligent way of assessing the knowledge of the students. The system should provide a tool where the teacher can assess and categorize questions in the item bank and do modifications according to the individual performance of the students. The items that are deemed to be very hard or to be very easy should be transformed suited to the students' performance. To determine the difficulty level of the questions in the item bank, K-Means clustering algorithm is suggested. The study aimed to develop a prototype that will help the students to improve their academic performance. The research was able to provide an item analysis using the examination results of the students. The level of difficulty, discrimination index, and response pattern were generated. The level of difficulty of each item were used as the observation value used in k-means clustering algorithm. There were five clusters generated that correspond to the five different difficulty levels namely: Very Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. The items that belonged to the Easy, Average, and Hard clusters remained in the primary item bank; whereas, the items included in the Very Hard and Very Easy cluster were put in a secondary item bank. These items were analyzed and modified. Practice exam or reinforcement exam was created to help the teacher in creating an assessment test.

It is also one of the most difficult production factor to understand, predict and manage. It is not just where the fish live; its quality directly affects growth rates, the fish's health and survival. Most fish kills, disease outbreaks, poor growth, poor feed conversion efficiency and similar management problems are directly related to poor water quality. The study and prediction of water quality is necessary to prevent serious problem that may occur during production period. In this study, water level, temperature, pH and DO levels are measured using Arduino microcontroller. User could receive information at predetermined intervals on preferred communication through SMS. Since integrating devices are comparatively not expensive; it usually consists of Arduino board, access to internet and relay frames and display system. With this integration system, farmer need not hire worker at their site, consequently drive down operating costs and improve efficiency. Prediction interface was developed using msSQL.

Authorities sought many solutions to ease and improve the flow of traffic; lessen travel times, optimizing not only vehicular movement but also that of persons, goods and services. These aforementioned observable traffic conditions and cases of traffic enforcement, prompted the researchers to come up with the idea of creating a device that is designed to aid traffic enforcers for more effective control of traffic management. The device provided a glove wearable technology that interpreted hand gestures made by the enforcer using different sensors that measure movements. The sensor and gesture values derived and generated by the traffic enforcer were transmitted to the receiver and displayed it to the traffic light. These commands included the bending of the finger by 45° and pointing of the lane where wanted to be on the 'Go' signal. Moreover, this device was applicable and suited for narrow and complicated roads. Also, the traffic officer can managed the traffic congestion better because he can see what phase is currently congested. In addition, the traffic officer can give way for ambulance to pass through for emergency and other purposes.

The growing global energy demand and continuous dependency on fossil fuels have triggered concerns over energy security and global warming. This issue has led to the prioritization of renewable sources in order to achieve sustainable development in the energy sector. The use of hybrid renewable sources and polygeneration systems to develop a sustainable energy system have also been emphasized in the literature. Thus, this study aims to optimize the design of a hybrid renewable energy-water system for tropical buildings. A fuzzy quadratic programming model was developed from a system architecture utilizing solar and biomass sources to meet electricity, cooling, heating, and water demands. The objective is to maximize the degree of satisfaction, which is based on multiple objectives of meeting the projected demand and minimizing the economic and environmental impacts. Technical, economic, and environmental constraints are included in the model based on fuzzy membership functions. The model was demonstrated using a case study considering a tropical commercial hotel building. The optimized system design yields a degree of satisfaction of 0.9999, compared to 0.1351 for a system with solar energy as the only source.

Water level prediction is a flood disaster issues which needs to have sufficient time for low-land communities to prepare and secure their lives and properties. This study aims to predict flood water level for longer term forecasting using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Specifically, it aims todetermine exogenous inputs that contribute to the prediction of flood water level; determine additional set of criterion in the selection of optimized ANN model and determine the best fit mathematical model for each optimized ANN model. The ANN models were trained using NNtool of Matlab with the default Levenberg-Marquardt as training algorithm. Eleven cases were formulated to determine the optimized model. Nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous input (NARX) was used in modellingall cases. Selection of optimized models was based on multi-criteria approach such as: Pearson R, mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Akiake's Final Prediction Error (FPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe's coefficient of efficiency (NSE). Result of the study shows that aside from upper stream, the tide level and rainfall were the exogenous inputs that contribute in predicting the water level at flood risk areas. The optimize model for both flood risk areas is a NARX model having upper stream water as the exogenous input that has the following multi-criteria values:for medium risk flood area, the optimized model has the following criterion values: MSE=0.000153, R=0.89519, FPE= 7.1355e-7, MAE=0.0066, RMSE=0.0089 and NSE=0.7868; and for high risk flood area: MSE=1.68e-5, R=0.85153, FPE=3.5245e-7, MAE=0.0027, RMSE=0.0035, and MSE=0.5729.

Three-phase electric motors are very rugged machines that have to withstand almost endless abuse from end users and still continue to perform to specification. There are several variables of which end user is often unaware. In this study, the researchers will conduct experiments in determining the performance of the FH90 Squirrel Cage Motor first by using the normal frequency supply, second with the use MP1015 Variable Frequency Inverter Drive in the input terminals and third with the aid of a thermistor in the rotor windings. The performance of the FH 90 motor can be determined by plotting the performance curves in each experiment. It is observed that when using the MP1015, the torque is constant when the supply frequency is varied from 48-90 Hz this is because the ratio of the voltage and frequency is constant throughout the experiment. In the third procedure, it is observed that when using MP 1015 VFID in the FH90 motor, the torque of the load is constant and the temperature rises only from 20-30 Hz and from 80 to 90 Hz. Beyond these values, the motor experiences a rise in temperature and thus more power losses has been developed. But when the motor is expected to run in normal frequency supply, the FH 90 motor experiences constant rise in temperature from 0.1 N-m to 0.5 N-m.

Natural disasters intensified by climate change stimulated the recent efforts to develop power system resilience both in the structural and in the operational sense. This study proffers an operational resilience framework that uses distributed generation (DG) and switches in order to pick up critical loads through dynamically forming DG-powered clusters in a radial distribution system damaged by a typhoon onslaught. As an innovation to consider a typhoon event's spatiotemporal conditions in cluster formation, we use wind-based line fragility curves to simulate line damages, and introduce a load priority update scheme based on government-mandated flood hazard levels. A mixed-integer optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the priority-weighted load pickup during clustering, without violating power system operation requirements. MATLAB-based implementations use the IEEE 37-node radial distribution test system, modified to include DG units and geographically mapped lines and nodes. Numerical results suggest effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of dynamically forming clusters optimized according to load pickup priorities and system operation requirements.

While IR provides non-obtrusive illumination for the camera, the same energy consumed does not provide the illumination to indoor spaces of the building. In this work, the characteristics of an LED based camera illumination for detecting human occupant motion and detecting the face was carried out. Using algorithms from the OpenCV library, the size of the bounding box during detection of motion, walking and faces were used as indication of the distance of the object from the camera. Results indicate that walking human motion is detected at illumination level of 32.3 lux at a distance of 12 feet, while face detection is obtained at illumination level of 15 lux from a distance of 8 feet.

8666399,Distribution Reliability | Distribution Systems | Optimization | Protective devices | SAIDI | SAIFI,0,Bersano R.,"© 2018 IEEE. The basic function of an electric power system is to provide a reliable source of electricity to connected loads, and electricity is one of the major driving forces of economic growth. An Intermittent and unreliable power supply can hinder economic growth and may also result to loss of investment. Thus, it is vital for electric distribution utilities to serve its customer with the utmost reliable power supply. Most common measurement of reliability of distribution utilities is through the use of reliability indices such as System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).

8666295,Consequentialism | Cyberbullying | Mobile Game Addiction | Mobile Gaming,0,Fabito B.,"© 2018 IEEE. Mobile gamification has been explored to understand the possibility of its application to promote engagement and motivation for learning among students. However, it cannot be disputed that the growing market for mobile games has drawn several ethical setbacks. Two of the setbacks arising from mobile gaming are addiction and cyberbullying. Mobile Game Addiction and Cyberbullying are ethical concerns that should be addressed respectively as it hampers regular individual activities particularly of students in an academic institution. In the Philippines, very few or no studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of ethical concerns in mobile gaming specifically on Mobile Game Addiction and Cyberbullying. It is the role of the present study to determine the prevalence of Cyberbullying and Addiction in the context of Mobile Gaming among students of one University in the Philippines through the Quantitative Approach. Existing Surveys were used to determine the possible prevalence of Cyberbullying and Addiction. Additionally, a discussion on consequentialism about the ethical dilemma in mobile gaming is addressed through Qualitative approach. From the Game Addiction Test, the over-all mean suggested that thirty-six (36) out of the eighty-eight (88) respondents are at risk for Mobile Game addiction, whereas, six (6) can be classified as mobile game addicts. The test also revealed that the respondents play mobile games for Mood Modification (the need to shift from a bad mood to a good mood). For Cyberbullying, it is not conclusive that majority of the respondents have experience or have initiated cyberbullying in mobile games. Nevertheless, a few of the respondents have become a victim or have initiated cyberbullying.

One problem in the healthcare industry in the Philippines is the maldistribution of doctors. This greatly affects the accessibility of patients to proper healthcare. As a matter of fact, in 2015, 59.2% of deaths in the Philippines are attributed as deaths unattended by a doctor. Although there are current government programs, which aim to solve this problem, the use of telepresence systems can be another viable solution as doctors can still provide quality healthcare services even when located in a remote area. One limitation of medical telepresence robots is the lack of medical features. For this reason, the developed telepresence system includes a telepresence robot called Akibot with integrated medical devices such as otoscope, stethoscope, and ultrasound probe. Akibot is a highly maneuverable remotely controlled telepresence robot designed for general practice medical consultation between doctors and a patient on a remote area.

In this paper, a 3D finite element model was developed based on the dimensions of the actual Ball Grid Array. The material properties applied are derived from a previous study by Tsai, et al in 2008. The model was subjected to the same thermal loadings as the experiment and was compared at each temperature level. A quarter model was made and appropriate constraints were applied to determine the proper thermal warpage calculations. The molding compound residual strain was implemented using the command object feature or the Mechanical ANSYS Parametric Design Language (MAPDL). A mesh independence test was also done to determine at which mesh setting yields a stable warpage calculation. The results from the 3D simulation compared to the experimental measurements and were determined to be reasonably consistent.

The use of biometrics provides a more reliable security layer in identification and user authentication in many fields of commercial and institutional transactions. Vascular vein patterns from the hand have recently been explored as another approach to the biometric modality because these innate patterns are constant, remains distinct lifelong; relatively stable, cannot be forged, tampered nor copied. This study proposes the use of a rotation invariant algorithm like ORB for a bimodal approach in the vein recognition from the palm and dorsal vein patterns of the hand. Using near-infrared LEDs, Raspberry Pi with NOIR camera module, a portable, real time hand vein pattern recognition device was developed. Image pre-processing, feature extraction, feature matching, database of user information and GUI are implemented in Raspberry Pi, Python and OpenCV Libraries. ORB was used for generating feature descriptors and BruteForce Matcher for feature matching. Match scores generated by the classifier from dorsal and palm vein were combined using sum-rule in score level fusion to generate the final recognition results.

A wireless sensor network (WSN) typically contains various sensor nodes which are spread across a geographical area for data collection like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, rain fall, and soil moisture. Sensor nodes in the wireless sensor networks, are usually constrained in resources, such as having limited amount of power, memory storage and communication capability. In order to conserve the power consumption of the sensor node, data compression will be implemented through application of algorithms such as Minimalist, Adaptive, and Streaming (MAS) Compression Algorithm and Sensor-Lempel Ziv Welch (S-LZW). Using these compression techniques, its effects on the power consumption of the sensor node was observed. Upon using statistical methods, when comparing the power consumption during transmission between uncompressed and MAS compressed data, a P-value of 0.001 was computed which is less than 0.05, which has a 95% confidence level. MAS compression algorithm was able to reduce power consumption during transmission, between 53.55439% and 55.95118% which signifies that the power consumption during transmission was reduced when applying data compression algorithms.",SCOPUS_ID:85064107020,"Compression of wireless sensor node data for transmission based on minimalist, adaptive, and streaming compression algorithm",2-s2.0-85064107020,,03982,"Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development",0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666320,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064107020,,,cp,Conference Paper
8666305,Human Robot Interaction | KUKA Robot | Microsoft Kinect | Speed and Separation Monitoring,0,Andres C.,"© 2018 IEEE. Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) has become one of the recent methods to ensure safety in Human Robot Interactions (HRI). SSM maintains a safe separation distance between the robot and any human collaborator and issues a safety-rated halt to the robot when the set safe distance is violated. SSM could be classified into two: Static, which uses a predefined offline safeguard volume and Dynamic, which uses a more-fit online-calculated volume. A trade-off arises between the two as Static SSM is often over conservative and significantly affect the productivity of the system, while dynamic SSM may become less reliable in terms of safety performance as the maximum velocity of the robot is increased. These trends are confirmed through the system created in this study. To overcome the trade-off, this study proposes a combination of the two in a tri-modal SSM. Using the KUKA Robot AGILUS SIXX as arm manipulator, Microsoft Kinect as sensor, JOpenShowVar as middleware, and MATLAB R2013a for the user interface, the researchers were able to create a system that offers a better trade-off compared to its counterparts. The proposed system is reliably safe at higher speeds compared to the dynamic implementation but still significantly productive compared to the static implementation.",SCOPUS_ID:85064106507,Tri-modal speed and separation monitoring technique using static-dynamic danger field implementation,2-s2.0-85064106507,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666305,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064106507,,,cp,Conference Paper

Pyrolysis kinetics is one way to produce bio-oil and biochar from a biomass product. It is a method to harvest clean energy from a biomass product. Moreover, kinetics and thermal composition of the biomass product is essential for pyrolysis design and optimization. However, industrial pyrolysis process is up to 200°C/min and lab scale pyrolysis temperature is up to 100°C/min. In this study, data from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been utilized and gathered to provide data on algal pyrolysis kinetics. To predict the pyrolysis kinetics at a heating rate of 200°C/min, artificial neural networks (ANN) has been utilized. Results show that ANN predicted the outcome of pyrolysis kinetics which had a correlation with heating rates (10°C, 25°C, and 50°C) of the sample. This is quantified by the correlation coefficient during training which is 0.9972. The average fit quality of the derived model with respect to the experimental data is 98.51%.

8666259,Life cycle assessment | Microalgae | Torrefaction,0,Rivera D.,"© 2018 IEEE. Biomass from microalgae and its residues can be burned directly, however it cannot be directly utilized to replace coal in the industry for power generation. This is due to its lower heating value as compared to coal. To solve this issue, a thermochemical process known as torrefaction is used. This increases the heating value of microalgal biomass to approximately the same level of coal. However, in order to consider for a large-scale production, the likely environmental impact of the prospective industrial scale should be gauged. Therefore, this paper presents a life cycle assessment of the production of torrefied microalgal biomass. Secondary data from the literature are then obtained and analyzed using a commercially available life cycle assessment tool SimaPro 8.5.2. Upon grouping the environmental impacts to three damage category, Damage to Human Health resulted to be the highest in all the production stages with 66.6% as compared to damage to Resources (29.2%) and Ecosystems (4.22%). The production stages are also weighed and the result revealed that the cultivation stage accounts for the highest combined environmental impacts with 65.7%. Upon scrutinizing the cultivation stage, large burden came from the use of fertilizers and electricity. Therefore, cultivation using inorganic fertilizers should be lessened. The use of waste nutrients from industries can be considered (organic fertilizers). Although microalgae have the potential for carbon capture and the torrefied algal biomass and its residue as a replacement for coal, the production process into its conversion to solid fuel using the electricity requires a suitable approach.

The productivity success of hard disk drive (HDD) head lies in the manufacturing capability of slider fabrication with high reliability using extensive electro static discharge (ESD) and contamination control. Both tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) sensors are the most extremely ESD sensitive device in the world and due to its nano-size architecture, the built-in ESD protective method being popularly used by semiconductor and electronics industries are not possible. In addition, most conventional ESD control practices being developed for highly sensitive electronic materials are not feasible or useful to protect the TMR or HAMR heads. Also, there is no immediate ESD protection on magnetic head sensor during actual slicing, grinding, lapping, photolithography and testing of slider head. The ESD damage and contamination issue are considered critical reliability concerns of most HDD manufacturers and these have cost hundreds of thousands of US dollars lost from the company when they struck. Therefore, this technical research aims to develop a full proof ESD and contamination control in slider fabrication through development of either a semi or a fully automated process in critical stations. The research will also tap the evaluation of improvised tooling/device to eliminate risks on particular processes and test stations that will fit the requirements of slider fabrication without inducing ESD and contamination to TMR or HAMR heads. Development of automated process is the key to future slider manufacturing, but this must be ESD safe, as well as full proof against transient current, electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise and cross contamination. The above process developments on slider fabrication will be subjected to series of both electrical and visual mechanical test to gather data and to conduct a series of design of experiments and statistical analysis to prove their feasibility on actual slider production and subjective to customer reliability qualification.

In effect, the inclusion of the visited nodes in the process increases the running time of the classic ant algorithm exponentially as the number deployed agent also increase. To minimize its running time and reduce the distance travelled, a path elimination rule was added to assist the ant algorithm process of selecting all valid nodes that are not previously visited.

Quantitative gait assessment is made possible through the use of instruments such as 3D motion capture systems (Mo-Cap) and its cheaper counterpart, an RGB-D camera. The cost-effectiveness of the RGB-D camera makes it a more practical instrument to use in most clinical settings but it is not as accurate as the Mo-Cap. This paper presents denoising of gait waveforms obtained from the most common parameters produced by RGB-D camera using LMS adaptive filter. The data used came from 14 study volunteers whose normal walking gait were recorded using VICON cameras and Microsoft Kinect v2 sensors. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated from the two gait waveforms. The adaptive filter was trained using training dataset to create a filter model that was then used for the testing phase. Two given data sets, unfiltered and filtered gait parameters, were compared to the motion capture system gait parameters using statistical tools. Unfiltered parameters from the RGB-D camera exhibit significant difference with the Mo-Cap parameters at an average percent error of 26.83%. By calculating statistical values such as mean, standard deviation and root mean square error (RMSE), the findings confirmed that filtered parameter data improved at an average of 11.34% and there is a reduction of rejected parameters by 6 using t-test.",SCOPUS_ID:85064136877,Denoising of spatiotemporal gait waveforms from motion-sensing depth camera using least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter,2-s2.0-85064136877,,undefined,Philippine Council for Health Research and Development,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666294,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064136877,,,cp,Conference Paper

Recent studies proved that advancements in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) have played a vital role for the rehabilitation of people suffering from motor neuron diseases, which affect either the upper limb, lower limb, or both. Despite the fact that significant progress has been done for the field of BCI systems relating to upper-limb impairment, studies supporting BCI for the lower limb are still insufficient. This study aims to develop an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor Imagery BCI system for lower limb movements usually used for everyday actions (i.e. walking up and down the stairs, and their sub-phases such as stance and swing) which will support the motor-impaired to be able to conduct daily life activities. In line with this, the brain activities were measured via EEG-based BCI system, using a 14-channel EMOTIV EPOC + device which provided raw signals. The acquired signals were then preprocessed using a built-in denoising filter and the stance and swing gait phases were segmented with the aid of a gyroscope. Each segment underwent feature extraction using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The interclass correlations of the extracted features were determined.

Selecting desirable applicants for an organization who has less tendency to quit their jobs are one of the major challenges in human resource management. Proper selection during pre-employment has a significant impact in an organization's productivity and performance. However, due to a prevalence of labor market competition, some companies are suffering to high turnover rate. It occurs when an applicant decides to quit and transfers to an organization which offers attractive benefits and compensation. This study helps human resource personnel to understand psychological climate and supports decisions in resolving employment turnover by selecting desirable applicants who has high probability of staying longer in an organization. Using the 12 dimensions of retention applied in generating association rules and naive bayes classifier, the researchers develop a custom application that can support organization's decision in relation to hiring process. Based on the results of 12 dimensions of retention, the system evaluated seven dimensions with poor psychological climate response resulting to higher possibility of employees to voluntarily quit his or her job. Moreover, upon generating the model for job position counter cashier, results show that age older than 20 years old and living away from workplace has higher probability of staying long in comparison to other applicants.

In this study the hybrid irrigation system model is the combination of the misting technique and the drip irrigation method. Based on the data gathered at the National Coffee Research Development Center at Cavite State University, predictions has been made using the regression technique. Variables such as temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture were analyze using the regression to determine the equation that would describe the relationships between the variables. Furthermore, the relationship between the soil moisture and water requirement was also established in order to provide suitable irrigation model for the germinating coffee seed. Results showed that there is a weak correlation between temperature and relative humidity as well as temperature and soil moisture in a controlled irrigation for the propagators using the hybrid irrigation system.

Fire detection systems have greatly contributed to the safety of the people against fire incidents. However, most of these systems are not for outdoor residential areas. Outdoor residential areas need devices that would detect fire outbreaks with faster conveyance of alert from strategic locations in the involved areas to the nearest fire stations. Using temperature and ionization smoke sensors, GPS and GSM modules, ZigBee module and ATmega328P, a wireless automated fire detection system is proposed. This design will include the entire area covered by the proposed system by installing intelligent sensor nodes and servers in strategic locations of the affected area. The proposed system will be capable of detecting the presence of smoke and fire in the areas covered by the proposed system. An alert message is then sent to the proposed system's intended recipients by wireless means.

Water is essential to daily life and access to a steady supply of water can be a problem especially those who are living in far-flung areas. Others have to rely on the rain to collect water, but during the summer season, this poses an immense challenge. People have to exert a lot of manpower to collect water specifically those who are far and elevated from the water source. They have to buy water pumps, powered either by gasoline or electricity. Places that have running water like a river, is an example of a body of water that can be a source using its current. The purpose of the study is to develop a river current hydrokinetic siphoning device that can collect water without using electricity or fuel. The current of the river drives the turbine to rotate and supplies water to the Polyethylene (PE) Coil that collects water, as the other intake rotates, pressure is created to push the liquid upward. The prototype can be used in different types of water as long as the water current is enough to drive the turbine. It must be submerged 1/2 ft. below water level and it is capable of siphoning water with a vertical height of 20 feet and can push water ranging from 492.15 to 656.17 feet in horizontal distance. The river current hydrokinetic siphoning device can collect 1 gallon of water for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The prototype has two floaters to adjust to different water levels.

A design of a secondary power supply using Proportional-Integrative-Derivative (PID) controller has been implemented for better compensation, response and output in comparison with a conventional control strategy of a switch mode converter. A boost converter for an automobile battery as a power source with adaptive control has been introduced in the design. The offsetting and joggling of a 3D printer is manifested as electronic load during the testing. An analysis about the modes of controlling a switch mode power supply (SMPS) has been made using: (1) MATLAB for simulation of graphical presentation of the method and for analysis of transient response of the design and (2) NI Multisim for simulation of SMPS circuit including PID control and conventional SMPS circuit with a fundamental compensation circuit. The two approaches are compared in this paper. The simulations have shown that PID compensates for error in output response and decreases the response time of the converter circuit. Overall the entire design scheme is successfully verified through simulations and by prototyping that shown improvement on dynamic performance (response and efficiency) as compared with the conventional scheme.

In this paper, the implementation of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Radar in Software Defined Radio (SDR) Platform is presented mainly for the purpose of detecting underground targets. The SDR platform used in this research is the National Instruments' (NI) Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP™). For the interfacing of the USRP, the software development environment NI LabVIEW™ is used. This approach takes advantage of the SDR system's versatility, like changing the waveform characteristics (frequency, transmit and receive gain) on the fly. In the FMCW Radar technique, a ramp signal is frequency modulated which results to a chirp waveform. The researchers developed a signal processing program in LabVIEW to analyze the received chirp signal and correlate it to the reference transmit signal which can then be analyzed and studied the received signal characteristics and behavior on the LabVIEW platform. This implementation can be a platform for designing low cost alternatives to the expensive commercial electromagnetic techniques like Ground Penetrating Radars, Time Domain reflectometers, Electrical resistivity devices, etc. The method presented in this paper is a precursory step of the researchers for developing and modeling cost effective, robust and marketable Underground Target Detection Radar system.

8666257,Context Recognition | Convolutional neural networks | Pedestrian detection | Traffic scene analysis | Vehicle detection,0,Billones R.,"© 2018 IEEE. In road traffic scene analysis, it is important to observe vehicular traffic and how pedestrian foot traffic affects the over-all traffic situation. Road context is also significant in proper detection of vehicles and pedestrians. This paper presents a vehicle-pedestrian detection and classification system with road context recognition using convolutional neural networks. Using Catch-All traffic video data sets, the system was trained to identify vehicles and pedestrians in four different road conditions such as low-altitude view T-type road intersection (DSO), mid-altitude view bus stop area in day-time (DS4-1) and night-time (DS4-3) condition, and high-altitude view wide intersection (DS3-1). In the road context recognition, the system was first tasked to identify in which of the four road conditions the current traffic scene belongs. This is designed to ensure a high detection rate of vehicles and pedestrians in the mentioned road conditions. Road context recognition has 98.64% training accuracy with 2800 sample images, and 100% validation accuracy with 1200 sample images. After road context recognition, a detection algorithm for vehicle and pedestrians was trained for each condition. In DSO, the training accuracy is 97.75% with 1200 image samples, while validation accuracy is 94.75% with 400 image samples. In DS3-1, the training accuracy is 98.63% with 1400 image samples, while validation accuracy is 98.29% with 600 image samples. In DS4-1, the training accuracy is 99.43% with 1400 image samples, while validation accuracy is 99.83% with 600 image samples.

This paper presents a study of eye fatigue and strain caused by prolonged exposure to digital screens. Electrooculogram (EOG) signals were used to analyze eye movements, particularly saccades. This type of eye movement can be observed when a person is reading or looking out the window of a moving car. On the other hand, ultrasonic signals were used for distance measurement. EOG signals were obtained using the BIOPAC system, while Arduino-based board was used to collect ultrasonic signals. The experimental analysis determined the appropriate ergonomic distance between the computer monitor and the user when reading. The least number of saccades (average of 9.18) can be observed at 20-25 inches. This means there is less muscle movement and less eye strain, thus a lower risk of computer vision syndrome.

Portable systems are the trend nowadays, especially during this time that handheld devices have almost the same capability as with most of our computers. Developing a portable system for identifying the specie of a dried sea cucumber would be the focus of this study. Sea cucumber is one of the highest valued marine products of the Philippines. When in dried form, a sea cucumber would be difficult to identify its specie. To correctly identify, the researcher proposed a system that could be use by the traders or collectors. Since most of the collectors and buyers of the dried sea cucumber were from different islands and barangays, having a portable device would be convenient. The prototype of the specie identifier was made up of two layers, the lower box was the base holding the retractable tray while upper box or top cover was the enclosure of most of the electronic components. Raspberry pi was the main controller, processing the data captured by the pi camera and executing different image processing techniques like feature extraction and classification to produce a predicted output. The whole system was powered by 18650 batteries and a power bank. The operation of the system can be controlled through a 7-inch touchscreen Pi display. The portable specie identifier system works properly according to its designed features and functionality. The system was tested using test data employing k-fold cross validation technique, it yields 75.26% overall accuracy in identifying dried sea cucumber specie.",SCOPUS_ID:85064121277,Development of a portable specie identifier for dried sea cucumber,2-s2.0-85064121277,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666401,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064121277,,,cp,Conference Paper

8666338,Agile | Lean | Software development | System dynamics,0,Ching P.,"© 2018 IEEE. Agile and Lean software development methods were conceptualized in response to the demands for greater flexibility and shorter lead times in the software industry. While successful to some extent, a significant number of cases have been documented where the methods failed to generate lasting improvement, or resulted in problems of a different nature. Based on Lean case studies, the cause of failure is likely the lack of a holistic view of the context of software development prior to applying either Agile or Lean methods. The current study applies the system dynamics framework in generating this perspective. This allowed for the software development process to be mapped as a collection of feedback loops. From doing so, it was found that developers tended to neglect key support activities under backlog pressure, which made the actual development processes less efficient. Based on the system structure, it is recommended that the causal relationship between the support activities and actual development be made explicit. This would serve as a feedback mechanism to reinforce practice of the support activities.",SCOPUS_ID:85064120102,Evaluating agile and lean software development methods from a system dynamics perspective,2-s2.0-85064120102,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666338,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064120102,,,cp,Conference Paper

8666404,Aeroelastic flutter | Multivariate quadratic regression | Optimization | Piezoelectricity | Wind belt energy harvester,0,Fernandez E.,"© 2018 IEEE. This paper presents the design optimization of a wind belt electric generator using piezoelectric transducer for low power devices. The current wind belt energy harvester usually generates electricity through electromagnetic induction wherein a permanent magnet that is on the oscillating membrane, which is the belt, between or in proximity with copper coils induces electrical current. This prototype innovates this conventional wind belt generator by replacing the magnet and copper coil components by a piezoelectric material. This harvester operates via aeroelastic flutter where a wind slightly about 3 m/s that passes through a membrane causes a vibration where the belt is pushed into two contradicting forces. Then the piezoelectric transducers at the end of the belt generates electricity through this vibrating motion. The alternating voltage induced from the piezoelectric transducer was then rectified and filtered enough to power up low power devices like an array of light emitting diodes. A series of experiments were conducted to optimize the wind belt design parameters such as the frame length, belt length, belt material, and the exposed length of piezoelectric transducer to obtain optimum induced voltage. Results show that the best belt material is the latex rubber, while the optimum frame and belt length are 0.86m and 0.75m, respectively. Also, the optimum length exposure of the piezoelectric transducer is found to be 75 percent. The prototype was also tested to determine the minimum run time the generator will yield a stable output.

Hence, this study proposes an intelligent route recommendation and road traffic information system that uses LTFRB data on 1) fare matrix computation (LRT 1, LRT 2, MRT 3, Bus, and Jeep) through utilizing Sakay.ph GTFS data, as well as 2) taxi pricing computation, and MMDA data (from their official Twitter account) on real-time traffic situation. Such data are used 1) to process the top three route recommendation choices, 2) to create attribute-based bag of words, extract appropriate dataset features, and classify the traffic congestion mode (Light, Light to Moderate, Moderate, Moderate to Heavy, and Heavy) in the involved road/s using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and 3) to rebuild the system model automatically in a certain time interval.

Efficiency is one of the most important characteristics of a solar panel. It is the ability of the solar panel to convert light energy to electrical energy. One of the factors that affect the solar efficiency is the temperature. As the temperature increases, the solar panel's efficiency decreases. Thus, the proponents developed a power effective, sustainable, and cost-effective cooling system that keeps the solar panel's temperature low by sprinkling water on the surface of the solar panel using an Arduino Microcontroller. After series of testing and evaluation, the cooling system was able to increase the efficiency up to 22.14% with a minimal water loss of 0.31% per hour. The cooling agent used which is the water was also found to be a reliable cooling agent since it only reached 23.49°C after four days of testing.",SCOPUS_ID:85064117412,Development of a water-based PV cooling system a cooling system,2-s2.0-85064117412,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666387,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064117412,,,cp,Conference Paper

The paper aims to characterize Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during visual imagery of basic shapes that includes square, triangle and circle with and without visual stimulus and neutral state using a 14- channel EEG Emotiv EPOC+. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the features and the transformed features or biomarkers were used to train the classifiers. Classifiers used in this study are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The results obtained from 5 study volunteers indicated that the highest contributions to the 56 new biomarkers are the higher order even central moments and more predominantly from channel T7. Also, the extracted features from EEG signals during visual imagery of different shapes with and without visual stimuli consistently showed a low degree of correlation. Furthermore, the dataset used to train the classifiers were subdivided into two: one containing neutral state with visual stimulus, and the other comprising neutral state without visual stimulus. Performance of different classifiers trained with and without visual stimulus yielded similar accuracies; however, the dataset with the absence of visual stimulus exhibit higher classification accuracies for all classifiers. In addition, all classifiers obtained high classification accuracies (>96%) for both datasets and the SVM performed best among the classifiers having accuracies of 97.5% and 99.5% for datasets with and without visual stimulus respectively.

Ovulation can be predicted in many ways; one way is by using the Basal Body Temperature (BBT). It is measured the exact moment the women wake up. The study was able to predict the ovulation day by using a Schmitt Trigger circuit and an algorithm named Raindrop Splash. The Schmitt Trigger circuit is placed in a thermally isolated system to test the validity of the circuit. The thermally isolated system acts as the body of the respondents. The simulated temperature from the Raindrop Splash Algorithm checks if there is an abrupt rise in temperature in the circuit and if there is a continuous increase of temperature as time goes by. The abrupt rise in temperature according to the algorithm is the same as the ovulation day. The researchers were able to come up with a printed circuit board with Schmitt Trigger comparator circuit which is configured for ovulation detection. The PCB circuit is tested in a thermally isolated integrated system in which the temperature is varied from 33°C to 38°C which is also the range of body temperature with tolerance.

Energy is a primary commodity of nature that transmits between parts of a system in the output of physical change within the system and usually considered as the capacity to do work. Energy sources could be abundant; however, conversion and utilization to a more effective output need to be discovered. There is a wide variety of existing vertical axis wind turbines, VAWT, but the efficiency is low compared to that of a horizontal axis wind turbine because of the presence of counter flow drag. In order to address this problem, a vertical axis wind turbine with deflectable blades that would minimize counter drag flow and maximize efficiency is designed and developed. The newly developed VAWT makes the blades deflect at a certain angle. The deflection of the blade eliminates the counter flow drag force that makes the efficiency of the vertical axis turbine increase. The results of the tests show that using the deflecting blades for vertical axis wind turbine is more efficient. The developed deflectable blade can be further improved by using lighter materials and a gear system can be considered for better speed ratio.",SCOPUS_ID:85064115174,Deflectable blades vertical axis wind turbine,2-s2.0-85064115174,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666385,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064115174,,,cp,Conference Paper

Hydroelectric power is a significant source of renewable energy generated by run-of-river hydropower plants. However, operation and maintenance of these plants pose a threat to the water quality of rivers. Diversion scheme adopted in these plants can substantially modify river ecosystems instream resulting to changes in the water quality parameters. These changes degrade the river ecosystem, thereby, compromising the health and growth of aquatic species. This study aimed to analyze water quality parameters used to evaluate the compliance to water quality standards. Based on DENR allowable values, change in temperature should not exceed 30 C and dissolved oxygen should not be lower than 5 mg/l. Regression analysis was used to establish relationships in analyzing water quality parameters. With the use of various regression machine learning models, the water quality dataset was modelled to predict the change in temperature and dissolved oxygen downstream using water level downstream and water temperature downstream as predictors.

However, it is acknowledged recently the harmful environmental and health impacts of these chemical admixtures, thus, paving the way to utilize sustainable green alternatives such as starch-based organic admixtures. In the case of the Philippines, arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) is an agricultural crop considered as one of the common sources of starch. Hence, making arrowroot a potential commercializes concrete admixture. The present study explored through optimization the applicability of arrowroot starch as organic admixture intended to improve the compressive strength of normal weight concrete. The study generally aimed to apply the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the amount of arrowroot starch along with the other variables such as curing time and water-cement ratio.

Falls are a serious public health problem, and in the recent years, the number of proposed fall detection systems that has been developed increased dramatically. In this study, a supervised machine learning-based fall detection was developed using a wearable accelerometer device fitted to the subject's waist. Fifteen volunteers performed a standardized set of movements which were developed by mimicking the scenarios in the FARSEEING Fall Repository, including 10 falling activities and 10 non-falling activities, resulting in a dataset with 900 samples. Supervised Learning is implemented by using two training sets: (1) 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities and (2) 10 real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository added to the 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities. Testing is done by using the remaining 20% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities, remaining five real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository, and actual testing in a simulated environment. Results show that the model with the training data using simulated falls only (Model 1) detected a 10% TPR while the model with real-world fall added (Model 2) detected a 100% TPR when tested using unseen data. Validating using the actual simulated fall and non-falls, Model l resulted in a 93.33% TPR and Model 2 at 96.67%.

Ventricular fibrillation is a type of cardiac arrhythmia which is responsible for several cases of sudden cardiac arrests. As many cases of arrhythmia result to fatality, it is the goal of this research to develop a method to analyze this condition through the use of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). EEMD is a variant of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which solves its weakness in terms of mode mixing. EEMD results to the decomposition of a signal into its intrinsic mode functions(IMFs). The IMFs, together with their power spectral densities (PSDs) of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals are analyzed for cases with and without ventricular fibrillation. Also, IMFs and PSDs are used as the features for classifying the presence of this condition. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the large dimension of the features. In classifying, k-NN classifier was used. It was found that the IMFs of a signal with and without ventricular fibrillation resampled at 250 Hz and at window length of 1000 has most of its signal energy at the 5thto 8th siftings. The highest overall classification accuracy of 83.75%was achieved with noise width of 0.1.

Most people use verbal language as a form of communication while deaf people use non-verbal communication called sign language. Several studies were already conducted in the field of signal processing focusing on sign language recognition. This study covers Filipino sign language and used Kinect V2. The proponents of this research analyzed the performance between two different methods. In the first method, the location of the joints of interest are tracked via the Cartesian coordinates of the joints while the second method tracks the location of the joints via spherical coordinates that includes normalization. Normalization is applied because the size and position of the user from the Kinect V2 may vary resulting to poor recognition. Both of these methods used the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and the Support Vector Machine individually. In total there are four results: results for the Spherical-DTW, Spherical-SVM, Cartesian-DTW and Cartesian-SVM. The scope of this study includes basic Filipino words provided by sign language experts wherein the hands are in open palm shape. Fingers and facial expression are not considered therefore, these gaps can be an opportunity for future studies.

The efficiency of various internet applications overshadows the importance of the library in the community. Nowadays, students prefer to search for information through the web than to go to the library. Librarians are settled with library systems that are bound only with the use of computers and laptops. However, the use of personal computers delimits the capacity of the librarian to work efficiently as he or she is constrained with its use as it is now allowed to move freely. Libraries would be more efficient and timely when the web and mobile application collaborates.

,Complex solvation | Conotoxins | Molecular dynamics | Preferential solvation,0,Gaza J.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Abstract: Cone snails are slow-moving animals that secure survival by injecting to their prey a concoction of highly potent and stable neurotoxic peptides called conotoxins. These small toxins (~ 10–30 AA) interact with ion channels and their diverse structures account for various variables such as the environment and the prey of preference. This study probed the conformational space of α-conotoxin PnIB from Conus pennaceus by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the conotoxin in complex solvent systems of water and octanol. Secondary structure analyses showed a uniform conformation for the pure (C100Oc, C100W) and minute (C95Oc, C5Oc) systems. In C50Oc, however, structural changes were observed. The original helices were converted to turns and were shown to happen simultaneously with the elongation of the helix and shortening of end-to-end distance. The transitions complement the orientation of the peptide at the interface. The shift to the broken helix conformation is marked by the rearrangement of solvent molecules to a framework that favors the accumulation of water molecules at residues 6–11 of the H2 region. This promotes specific protein–solvent interactions that facilitate secondary structure transitions. As PnIB has shown favorable binding toward neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, this study may provide insights on this conotoxin’s therapeutic potential.

There is evidence of research productivity of faculty and students but utilization can still be improved especially in community services applications. International linkages are not yet evident but local linkages with local universities are already in place. Learning resources available are those required by CHED only. There are no graduate programs offered in FCPC. This is expected since the CHED requires an HEI to have a Level III accredited status to be granted with a government permit.

,Bamboo | Compressive strength | Construction material | Finite modelling analysis | Tensile strength,0,Doreen Esplana Candelaria M.,"© 2019 ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network. All rights reserved. Construction materials are selected based on two factors: structural integrity and economy. However, there is an emerging issue with regards to building materials, and that is sustainability, which considers the environmental load of a construction material. Bamboo's lightweight and flexibility make it a good alternative for residential construction in seismic. In this study, bamboo was tested for its material properties. Layered tensile tests and full-culm compressive tests were done to get the material properties of the bamboo. The top part of the bamboo culm recorded the highest tensile strength per layer, with its outer layers having tensile strength as high as 600 MPa. The tensile strength of its middle and inner layers, on the other hand, were approximately 450 MPa and 180 MPa, respectively. As for the compressive strength, the top part of the bamboo culm recorded the highest compressive strength with an average of 76.84 MPa. The middle part of the bamboo culm recorded the lowest compressive strength with an average of 62.55 MPa. The bottom part of the bamboo culm recorded an average compressive strength of 69.49 MPa. These properties were then used to construct an orthotropic material model and simulate the stresses using finite element modeling. The FEM model of a simply-supported beam with a concentrated load at midspan was made. To validate the orthotropic material model for bamboo, three-point bending tests of bamboo beams were conducted and compared with the simulation results. The results show that in modeling the material properties of the bamboo to check for deflections, the orthotropic model gives more accurate results.",SCOPUS_ID:85073539756,Determination of the properties of Bambusa blumeana using full-culm compression tests and layered tensile tests for finite element model simulation using orthotropic material modeling,2-s2.0-85073539756,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,,1,54-71,ASEAN Engineering Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073539756,9,,ar,Article

Student retention is an important issue faced by Philippine higher education institutions. It is a key concern that needs to be addressed for the reason that the knowledge they gain can contribute to the economic and community development of the country aside from financial stability and employability. University databases contain substantial information that can be queried for knowledge discovery that will aid the retention of students. This work aims to analyze factors associated with student's success among first-year students through feature selection. This is a critical step prior to modelling in data mining, as a way to reduce computational process and improve prediction performance. In this work, filter methods are applied on datasets queried from university database. To demonstrate the applicability of this method as a pre-processing step prior to data modelling, predictive model is built using the selected dominant features. The accuracy result jumps to 92.09%. Also, through feature selection technique, it was revealed that post-admission variables are the dominant predictors. Recognizing these factors, the university could improve their intervention programs to help students retain and succeed.

Another study shows a similar claim; however, this study utilizes the pronominal systems of major Philippine languages and uses an ergative-absolutive framework. This research examines the pronouns of Southern Alta language. It aims to contribute in the typological studies of pronominal systems of Negrito and Non-negrito languages. This study employs an ergative-absolutive framework. The initial result shows that the pronominal systems of the Southern Alta language consist of absolutive, ergative, oblique, and genitive pronouns. The ergative-absolutive framework unravels the morphosyntax of the pronominal system of Southern Alta. The framework helps describe the functions and characteristic of the different sets of pronouns. The study also reveals linguistic phenomena such as inclusivity/exclusivity, first person dual pronouns, homomorphy, cliticization, hierarchy, person-deixis interface and portmanteau pronouns.

After the system detected that swine was under thermal stress, the misting and ventilation is activated that reduce the amount of heat the swine had experienced. Two test was conducted for comparison. A controlled setup with the misting and ventilating and an uncontrolled with only the thermal camera and microphone. The data gathered proves that maintaining the pig's temperature at normal levels through the help of an automated sprinkling and ventilating device results to better growth performance.",SCOPUS_ID:85072644579,Swine grunt analysis through intensity and frequency isolation with thermography using Adafruit AMG8833 IR thermal camera breakout for swine stress detection and reduction,2-s2.0-85072644579,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1117/12.2540959,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781510631137'}]",0277786X,,,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072644579,11198,,cp,Conference Paper

The population of those who are developing caries lesions are increasing. To aid dental practitioners in detecting and identifying caries lesions that the time needed to observe an active lesion can be shortened and be more objective is a great help in slowing down the increasing rate of dental cases. The use of Near infrared light as a non-ionizing alternative for radiograph has been used in several medical studies. To maximize the use of NIR light, a prototype with image filtering and segmentation process and machine learning program was designed to identify caries lesion severity using the International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS) Caries Merged Categories. It uses CART (Classification and Regression Trees) a decision tree algorithm that trains to classify data and uses various classifiers for machine learning and model training. In the study, images with NIR illumination were used to test the performance of the prototype which was assessed by the dental practitioner beforehand. A total of 122 tooth samples were used in the simulation. Twenty percent (20%) of the total samples were classified as R0, 40% as RA, sixteen percent (16%) as RB and twenty-four percent (24%) as RC according to the ICCMS caries categories. The prototype was proven to yield results with a confidence level not less than ninety-five percent (95%). The Study was relevant to the process of immediate and non-ionizing determination of carries lesions and to the developing role of NIR light usage for tooth illumination.",SCOPUS_ID:85072634702,Caries lesion detection tool using near infrared image processing and decision tree learning,2-s2.0-85072634702,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1117/12.2540896,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781510631137'}]",0277786X,,,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072634702,11198,,cp,Conference Paper

,Acoustic sensors | Microcontrollers | Road flood | Social media | WiFi shield,2,Abana E.,"Copyright © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved. Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters in the world. It occurs when water from heavy rains exceeds the capacity of the river banks into which it runs. Some roads are also being affected when this natural phenomenon happens which lead to closure of roads. This closure, however, are often dissiminated late to the people that are passing through the closed roads. For this purpose, a Road Flood Warning System with Information Dissemination via Social Media has been developed to provide timely flood alert information to the public. The system determines the depth of the water through an ultrasonic sensor and disseminates the data gathered to the Internet through the use of social media sites specifically Twitter and Facebook. Moreover, the system has a LED matrix and light emitting diode to display whether the roads are passable during the occurrence of floods.

,C5.0 | CHAID | Decision tree | Educational data mining | Prediction model,0,Jorda E.,"© International Research Publication House. Many engineering students in Technological University of the Philippines Manila (TUPM) were either dropouts or dismissed from the engineering program they enrolled in. The dismissal or dropping out of students resulted to wastage of the scarce resources of the government and deprived the opportunity of the other students. TUPM needs to increase the retention rate to lessen the number of students who will drop out, on probation or be dismissed from College of Engineering (COE). Predictive modeling could be one of them. It is used to detect student behavior, predicting or understanding student educational outcome. It is one of the current popular method in Educational Data Mining (EDM). EDM is a field of scientific inquiry for the development of method to discover unique kind of data in educational settings, and using this method to understand better the students and their learning environment. As such, the study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model that will serve as a framework in predicting the academic performance of the engineering students towards an improved retention rate at TUPM. The research design of the paper was descriptive-quantitative. The data of the engineering students’ final grades from school year 2008 - 2015 were gathered from the Electronics Registration System of TUPM. The dataset was divided into two sets: Training and testing set. The training set was used to build and validate two decision tree algorithms namely, C5.0 and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), using IBM SPSS Modeler Version 18.0 based on their overall accuracy and ten-fold cross validation. To determine their significant difference, t-test was used. Furthermore, the testing set was used to evaluate C5.0 and CHAID on their overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Based on the result of the overall accuracy it was found out that C 5.0 was slightly higher than CHAID and both were valid. However, the predicted model is CHAID based on the evaluation of the two algorithms. Hence, CHAID was the best early warning system for TUPM to detect the students who are academically at risk. As such, the study concludes that CHAID modeling algorithm suited best as the predictive model for identifying students who were likely to be retained in the COE program and those who were academically at-risk.",SCOPUS_ID:85069999227,Predictive model for the academic performance of the engineering students using CHAID and C 5.0 algorithm,2-s2.0-85069999227,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,09743154,6,917-928,International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069999227,12,,ar,Article

One common problem in vehicle and pedestrian detection algorithms is the mis-classification of motorcycle riders as pedestrians. This paper focused on a binary classification technique using convolutional neural networks for pedestrian and motorcycle riders in different road context locations. The study also includes a data augmentation technique to address the un-balanced number of training images for a machine learning algorithm. This problem in un-balanced data sets usually cause a prediction bias, in which the prediction for a learned data set usually favors the class with more image representations. Using four data sets with differing road context (DS0, DS3-1, DS4-3, and DS4-3), the binary classification between pedestrian and motorcycle riders achieved good results. In DS0, training accuracy is 96.96% while validation accuracy is 81.52%. In DS3-1, training accuracy is 93.17% while validation accuracy is 86.58%.

,Educational technology | Online collaboration tool | Software effectiveness | Usabil-ity metrics,0,Tarun I.,"© 2019 Informing Science Institute. Aim/Purpose There is a huge array of educational technology tools that are now in use today. These tools have changed the way teachers teach and the way students learn. Among the many educational technology tools that are gaining popularity are the online collaboration tools. Online collaboration tools are web-based tools that allow individuals to do things together online like messaging, file sharing, and assessment. However, when new educational technology is integrated in the classroom, its effects must be determined as this is an essential component for evaluation. Having the tool is not enough, there has to be an evaluation of its quality to make it more effective. It is on this premise that the customized online collaboration tool of one university in the Philippines was assessed. The study specifically aimed to identify the perceived effectiveness of the custom-ized online collaboration tool; and identify the effectiveness of using Usability Metrics for Effectiveness. Background Most studies provide evaluation of newly developed software using a set of quality standards such as functionality and usability. However, there is limited evidence where online collaboration tools are evaluated on their effectiveness using user's perception as well as assessing their usability using a set of effec-tiveness metrics. Methodology The study employed questionnaire-based (n=127) and metrics-based (n=81) approaches. Data gathered were analyzed using simple and relative frequencies, weighted mean, ANOVA, and Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference). Contribution This study supplements the literature regarding the effectiveness of online col-laboration tools that are used for teaching and learning particularly those that are custom-made for an institution. It provides additional information on other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of customized online collaboration tools. It likewise provides information on the difference between what the users report about the tool's effectiveness and what the metrics show. Findings The customized online collaboration tool was perceived to be very effective for collaboration, teaching and learning. But there is a significant difference on the students' perception based from their courses and year levels. The customized online collaboration tool's effectiveness as regards its application performance is poor because of design interface faults. However, the customized online collab-oration tool has good completion rate. Recommendations for Practitioners Findings suggest that the customized online collaboration tool can be an alter-native tool to open-source learning platforms which faculty members may use for teaching and learning as students find it very effective not only for collabo-ration but for teaching and learning as well. However, errors caused by interface design problems must be addressed to yield a higher application performance rating and higher completion rate. Recommendation for Researchers Further assessment on the tool's effectiveness using an empirical study is rec-ommended to provide additional definitive evidence which may support the benefits of using online collaboration tools in the classroom.",SCOPUS_ID:85068261563,The effectiveness of a customized online collaboration tool for teaching and learning,2-s2.0-85068261563,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.28945/4367,,15479714,,275-292,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068261563,18,,ar,Article

The Philippine archipelago is a tropical country that experiences only two major seasons annually: wet (June-November) and dry (December-May). Due to these conditions, the country is bound to experience significant amounts of rainfall, followed by drought. Hence, studying long-term rainfall trends is highly beneficial for the country's livelihood and safety. In this work, we studied the rainfall distribution in the National Capital Region covering the period of 2013 to 2016, and analysed the data using the Mann-Kendall Test and the Bootstrap procedure. Using a monthly scale, we found a negative trend, signifying a decrease in rainfall amount over the four years of data. Interestingly, we found a positive trend using a yearly scale, showing an increase of rainfall overall. Therefore it is quite risky to generalize a certain region's rainfall condition just by looking at it annually, but must consider as well its seasonal and monthly phenomena for a more detailed analysis. We note also that the area being studied was considerably large and the rainfall data varied with the location of the weather station where it was obtained.

Newspapers provide factual reports on current events. However, news media has been shown to be ideologically biased, often negatively shaping the readers' point of view. News on controversial issues makes the bias of the newspaper or its writers more visible. This study aims to measure the objectivity of newspapers by classifying news articles from three newspaper agencies covering the 2017 Battle of Marawi in Southern Philippines. We used Aylien Sentiment Analysis Tool to detect the bias or polarity in each news article (whether positive, negative or neutral). Negative articles on Marawi dominated the three broadsheets (45.1% to 59.9%) while the neutral articles were the least frequent (16.1% to 21.2%). These results indicate that newspapers apply unequal space on the different sides of an issue, which may lead to unbalanced reporting. We also note that despite the varying number of total articles, the three papers applied the same proportion of positive, negative and neutral articles, which may imply collusion. The emergence of Big Data greatly increases the speed of gathering news articles on any given issue, while the Internet of Things enables readers and journalists to measure the objectivity of the news.",SCOPUS_ID:85067484759,Bias in Filipino newspapers?

Depression is a mental illness that negatively affects how a person feels, thinks and acts. In this work, we used an online survey to ask 501 Filipino university-age students on symptoms commonly associated with depression: sadness or isolation, headaches or migraine, anxiety over everyday activities, moodiness or irritability or agitation, chronic fatigue, and low self-esteem or motivation. We learned that all respondents experience at least one symptom weekly. Most respondents (52.7%) experience all six symptoms weekly, with 1 to 3 days a week being the most common frequency. An overwhelming majority attributed such symptoms to academics (92.6%), followed by family (69.5%) and friends (49.5%). Lastly, most (41.9% - 59.7%) believe they have around 1-3 friends with the same symptoms that they experience. The researchers are calling for an increased awareness of mental health issues and good practices, especially within homes and schools, to address the prevalence of depression in university-age Filipinos. The prevalence of Big Data and the Internet of Things within this particular demographic greatly enhances the ability of mental health professionals and researchers to detect and hopefully address the symptoms of depression.",SCOPUS_ID:85067464554,Investigating the presence of the symptoms of depression among university-age Filipinos,2-s2.0-85067464554,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789897583698'}]",,,359-363,"IoTBDS 2019 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067464554,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Data Analysis | Psychophysics | Surveys | Synesthesia,0,Santos N.,"© 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon involving the stimulation of multiple senses. In this work, we determine the presence of sound-gustatory synesthesia by looking at the possible effects of background music on the perceived taste of a coffee-sugar mixture. We asked participants (N = 83) to listen to music while identifying the tastes they perceived drinking a coffee-sugar sample. Our results showed that sweetness was perceived more while listening to the “Slow” music, which is consistent with previous work. The perception of sourness also increased with the tempo of the music, consistent with work associating sourness with pitch. Interestingly, participants also perceived saltiness and sourness even though the ingredients did not contain ingredients with those tastes, which provides further evidence of sound influencing taste perception. This study has shown the presence of sound-gustatory synesthesia in a typical coffeehouse setting, introducing potential applications in psychophysics, food science, and other complex systems research. Our algorithm has also shown how quantitative tools can be used in a qualitative field such as psychological perception. We expect multisensory, interconnected technology in the Internet of Things to spread the experience of synesthesia within a population, with Big Data enabling researchers to detect and measure synesthesia much more accurately.",SCOPUS_ID:85067456401,Investigation of sound-gustatory synesthesia in a coffeehouse setting,2-s2.0-85067456401,BDS,undefined,British Deer Society,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789897583698'}]",,,294-298,"IoTBDS 2019 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067456401,,,cp,Conference Paper
,3D information retrieval | 3D models | multi-feature retrieval and view-based retrieval | shape matching,0,Ruiz C.,"© 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Most research on 3D model retrieval focus on shape as the main feature used for search and retrieval. In this paper, we explore augmenting 3D shape-based similarity measures by combining shape with color features. There are already numerous techniques for content-based 3D model retrieval utilizing shape, some use global shape features, shape distributions, or view-based methods. This paper uses a view-based approach using 2D projections of 3D models taken from different viewpoints. The main problem with view-based techniques is how to normalize the rotation of the mesh in 3D space to properly align the model to the projection planes. In our work, we use Normal-vectors PCA (NPCA). The 3D model is first projected onto three planes using their normal vectors and gray-level images (inner elevations) that describe the depth information are generated. The angular radial transform (ART) from MPEG-7 is then used on these inner elevations to extract a feature descriptor. These descriptors are called the inner elevation descriptor (IED) and are used to match the query with the database object. This shape feature is then augmented using color histograms considering perceptual color similarity. It is then tested on the Princeton Shape Benchmark and compared to well-known approaches.",SCOPUS_ID:85067433053,Multi-feature 3D model retrieval using view-based techniques,2-s2.0-85067433053,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1080/1206212X.2019.1625529,,1206212X,,,International Journal of Computers and Applications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067433053,,,ar,Article
,,1,Hasan S.,"© 2019 by The USENIX Association. All Rights Reserved. Hundreds of millions of people still live beyond the coverage of basic mobile connectivity, primarily in rural areas with low population density. Mobile network operators (MNOs) traditionally struggle to justify expansion into these rural areas due to the high infrastructure costs necessary to provide service. Community cellular networks, networks built “by and for” the people they serve, represent an alternative model that, to an extent, bypasses these business case limitations and enables sustainable rural coverage. Yet despite aligned economic incentives, real deployments of community cellular networks still face significant regulatory, commercial and technical challenges. In this paper, we present CommunityCellularManager (CCM), a system for operating community cellular networks at scale. CCM enables multiple community networks to operate under the control of a single, multi-tenant controller and in partnership with a traditional MNO. CCM preserves flexibility for each community network to operate independently, while allowing the mobile network operator to safely make critical resources such as spectrum and phone numbers available to these networks. We evaluate CCM through a multi-year, large-scale community cellular network deployment in the Philippines in partnership with Globe, the largest MNO in the country, providing basic communication services to over 2,800 people in 17 communities without requiring changes to the existing regulatory framework, and using existing handsets. We demonstrate that CCM can support independent community networks with unique service offerings and operating models while providing a basic level of MNO-defined service. To our knowledge, this represents the largest deployment of community cellular networks to date.",SCOPUS_ID:85071161627,Scaling community cellular networks with communitycellularmanager,2-s2.0-85071161627,USAID,undefined,United States Agency for International Development,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781931971492'}]",,,735-750,"Proceedings of the 16th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, NSDI 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071161627,,,cp,Conference Paper

The developed traffic detection system provides an approximation of the number of vehicles per hour in two-lane roads. Based on the quantity of vehicles in the road, traffic status is classified as light, moderate or heavy. A traffic volume of less than 420 vehicles/hour is considered as a light traffic, between 420 and 1200 vehicles/hour as a moderate traffic, and greater than 1201 vehicles/hour as heavy traffic. The traffic detection in this study uses a threshold algorithm with peak counting.

Comparisons were made between the aforementioned machine learning algorithms by evaluating the accuracy and the average running time of each training model. Results of the study show that the SGD is superior in terms of accuracy but falls short to k-NN and SVC in terms of running time. In this fashion, a plot between the accuracy and the running time was made and it was observed that algorithms with higher accuracies correspondingly have also higher running times.

8666403,Bluetooth | BlueZ | Extended Kalman Filter | GPS | Particle Filter | RSSI,0,Cruz J.,"© 2018 IEEE. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a relative variable related to signal strength. The strength of the signal transmitted is used in continuous close-proximity tracking applications. The approximate exact location of a node is estimated using various kinds of filtering techniques. The demand for close-proximity tracking or location and proximity integration increases with the society's dependency to mobile devices but using such geolocation services are power-hungry and is directly affected by atmospheric conditions. Present tracking services are made relative to the earth's axis. To address these gaps, this study focuses on integrating Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) into a system of Bluetooth-enabled nodes that are capable of relative positioning in three-dimensional space. Three nodes made of Raspberry Pi Zero are tracked by a parent device made of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The nodes' coordinates are displayed in the parent device's dashboard. Detection of the nodes are done using the library BIueZ. These nodes broadcast themselves to the parent device to determine their range and location using a 750-meter range Bluetooth dongle. The device is tested in both open areas, a memorial park and a beach resort. Using spiral method, the weakest RSSI value measured is -142dB at 776.43 meters and -23dB at 0 meter.

The system will control factors such as temperature, light, relative humidity, and nutrient concentration in the water for the crops to grow under ideal conditions. The group believes that this will bring the farming into a new level, allowing every consumer to have their own vertical farming set-up in their own households without worrying about it thus eliminating their need to rely on food manufacturers.

8666421,Fuzzy Logic | Head orientation | Human-robot collaboration | Risk estimation | Upper body orientation,0,Beltran E.,"© 2018 IEEE. The increasing trend of using industrial robots due to their robotic strength and endurance made the manufacturing processes more efficient. Humans, however, are still an integral part in this industry due to processes that robots could not automate, therefore, the need for human-robot collaboration (HRC) arises. The matter of safety arises during HRC since industrial robots are typically enclosed around a work fence. The current effective implementations for HRC consider humans as a foreign obstacle in the workspace and adapts based on its distance and velocity with respect to the robot manipulator. These parameters, however, do not fully translate the risks associated with each situation. To overcome this, a risk estimate must first be produced. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic-based risk estimation which takes inputs from the human such as head orientation and upper body orientation together with the pairwise distance of the human and robot, the speed of the robot manipulator, and speed of the human. This was implemented using a Kinect V2 depth sensor, and a KUKA KR6 R700 6-DoF robot manipulator.",SCOPUS_ID:85064104821,Fuzzy logic-based risk estimation for safe collaborative robots0,2-s2.0-85064104821,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666421,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064104821,,,cp,Conference Paper

The increasing number of vehicles for every year in the Philippines produces a bigger percentage of causing severe traffic congestion in the three leading roads (Circumferential Road 5, EDSA, and Commonwealth Avenue) in Metro Manila. The researchers observed that most of the implemented technology used to detect traffic is by using a surveillance camera which requires labor and costly, while other web and mobile traffic information system used crowdsourcing and mostly owned by private. The researchers aim to develop a real-time road traffic information system by using the traffic-related tweets from MMDA (Metropolitan Manila Development Authority) official Twitter account to aid the current problem of providing sufficient road traffic information in the country. In this research, the traffic-related tweets from MMDA data are fetched using Twitter Streaming API, filtered by using Named Entity Recognition, preprocessed by applying tokenization, frequency counting and removal of unnecessary symbols, features were extracted by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify the significant topic segments (time, day, lane of road, road direction, location and traffic mode) and Linear Regression was used for pattern recognition. Also, this study compares four machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbor) for the proper identification of the most effective algorithm that will be used to for traffic mode classification. The experimental result shows that k-NN produced the best performance compared to other algorithms with 84.00% classification accuracy in anticipating the traffic congestion modes (Light, Light to Moderate, Moderate, Moderate to Heavy, and Heavy) in Metro Manila, Philippines.",SCOPUS_ID:85064104691,An intelligent road traffic information system using text analysis in the most congested roads in Metro Manila,2-s2.0-85064104691,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666416,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064104691,,,cp,Conference Paper

Automatic classification of threat objects in X-ray images is important because of terrorist incidents happening in every country especially in the Philippines. Manual inspection using X-ray machine is prone to human error due limited amount of time given to the operator to check the baggage. This task is also stressful because there are lots of objects to be identified and needs full attention. Over long period of time, the performance of human inspector decreases and the chance of missed detection increases. As a solution to the problem, this paper used the concept of transfer learning in classification of threat objects. The threat objects used in the experiment consists of 4 classes such as blade, gun, knife and shuriken. The dataset came from the GDXray database, a public database of X-ray images. Experiment results showed that by using the concept of transfer learning with data augmentation and fine-tuning, threat objects can be classified at 99.5% accuracy.",SCOPUS_ID:85064104605,Threat object classification in x-ray images using transfer learning,2-s2.0-85064104605,,undefined,De La Salle University,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666344,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064104605,,,cp,Conference Paper

Falciparum, one of the most common parasitic strains of malaria. The device uses a camera module attached to the eyepiece of the microscope to analyze the slide, and a set of stepper motors attached to the stage control to adjust the position of the mechanical stage. The flood-fill algorithm is used to analyze each field of view (FOV) of the slide to count the number of red blood cells and infected cells. Furthermore, while manual differential counting includes the analysis of hundreds of fields of views, the device uses the numerical method, natural neighbor interpolation (NNI), to reduce the number of slides to be examined, thereby making the process much more efficient.

Gasification is a thermo-chemical process, which convert solid biomass into combustible gas called producer gas. In this study a combustion of producer gas was combined with the diesel fuel to determine its engine performance and the emission produced. The study focused on the maximum diesel fuel replacement rate applied in an induced-draft based gasification set - up. This paper investigate the effect of a producer gas flow rate on the engine performance by using the force-draft based gasifier. A mixture of Jatropha seed and Jatropha press-cake in 1:1 ratio (volumetric basis) was used as the feedstock for the throat less downdraft gasifier. The gaseous product was used in a 2.5 kWe (Kilowatts electrical) diesel generator set to partially replace the diesel fuel. Two producer gas flow rates were chosen in studying the engine performance and emission characteristics: 10 kg/h and 20 kg/h. The engine load was varied from 0.5 kWe to 2.0 kWe in 500 We increment. The result showed that the diesel fuel replacement was maximized at 1 kWe. Diesel fuel replacement rate is higher at the higher fuel gas flow rate. The maximum diesel fuel saving was 70% when 20 kg/h gas is introduced, and the engine was operated at 1.0 kWe load or 40% at full load. The specific diesel fuel consumption was found to be lower at dual fuel mode as compared with single diesel mode in over the entire load range.

In image steganography, the direct trade-off between the aspects of image's imperceptibility and payload capacity has always been a long-time challenge wherein the improvement of one aspect degrades the other. The more secret data is embedded into an image, the more it begins to look different from the original image. The more the image looks altered, the more it will be suspected of hiding something else other than the visible picture that it is displaying. This study proposes a novel image steganographic approach that produces secret-embedded images with payload capacity comparable with other late variations of spatial domain steganography techniques but with a better imperceptibility level. The nature of the approach is similar to classic LSB (Least Significant Bit) substitution steganography techniques wherein the bit information of the secret message is embedded into the image by replacing the LSB value of its pixel, except that this approach had the embedding bits undergo a series of evaluated and scored bit rotation and inversion operations prior bit replacement in its attempt to embed secret bits into an image with minimal pixel distortion as possible. This study however does not explore the security aspect of the generated image against its resistance to geometric and steganalysis attacks.",SCOPUS_ID:85064124858,Adaptive bit rotation and inversion scoring: A novel approach to LSB image steganography,2-s2.0-85064124858,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666228,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064124858,,,cp,Conference Paper

Both the preparation of a reliable all-atom model of a polyamide (PA) membrane and the determination of its electrostatic parameters are considered significant challenges in a proposal to study forward-osmosis-dewatering of microalgae using molecular dynamics (MD). Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations can effectively calculate for optimized structure and electrostatic properties, thus, employed to model and characterize the PA membrane starting from its molecular unit. The performed structural optimization resulted to the most stable configuration of the PA unit with bond length values that showed strong stability in the molecule such as the amide bond length of 1.413 Å which was found to differ from that of a related study by 3%. The calculated charge density distributions, electrostatic potential isosurface, and Mulliken charges on the PA unit provided potential binding sites and insights on the formation of amide bonds on the PA molecule. The non-amidebonded nitrogen atom of m-phenylene diamine (MPD) was found to be the most active site in the molecule due to its highest magnitude of negative charge (positive Coulomb potential), suggesting that amide bond-formation with a carbon atom of a trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer is most likely to occur during polymerization. The calculated charges in the amide group and the zero-net sum of these charges also agreed reasonably well with another study. The results are of vital importance in parameterizing the interaction potentials of PA for use in the MD simulations.",SCOPUS_ID:85060919391,Density functional theory-based modeling and calculations of a polyamide molecular unit for studying forward-osmosis-dewatering of microalgae,2-s2.0-85060919391,,undefined,Commission on Higher Education,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-12,10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666436,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538677674'}]",,,,"2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management, HNICEM 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060919391,,,cp,Conference Paper

Nowadays, the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is popular due to its small incision and faster recovery compared to open surgery. However, small working envelopes due to the use of multiple trocars restrict the use of MIS instruments. Performing a complicated surgical operation requires a very skillful surgeon. Many researches on the use of robotic surgery were proposed and developed recently. With robots, operation accuracy can improve significantly, reducing labor intensity and minimizing the effect of human errors. One of the critical parameters of robotic surgery is force sensing. There are several force sensing types and one of them is sensing with the use of pneumatic cylinder. This force sensing utilizes compressible air characteristics and does not require any sensor on the instrument tip. This method is superior to other sensing techniques in terms of structure. Its only drawback is the modeling and computational complexity. Pneumatics has high non-linearity generated by air compressibility. In order to sense force accurately, a complex model needs to be established. In this study, neural network was used to estimate the external force on a pneumatic cylinder. The pneumatic system model was developed in MATLAB R2018a that takes into consideration the compressibility and the friction. To simulate the network model, a direct external force was applied to the pneumatic cylinder.

Southeast Asia is one of the world's fastest growing economic regions. Many metropolitan areas meanwhile have suffered from unsustainable transportation system, mainly owning to exploding private vehicle dependency. The prerequisite of designing policy having a negative impact on car dependency is to ascertain determinants of household vehicle ownership level. This study aims to investigate the impact of socio-economic characteristics and urban structure factors on a number of vehicles owned by households in Metro Manila at the disaggregate level, using the Multinomial Logit (MNL) regression. The empirical findings highlight that households getting higher accessibility to railway stations are less car-dependent, while households living close to a central business district (CBD) are likely to own more vehicles. Another finding indicates that households residing in the high-density area have the highest propensity to hold more vehicles, contrary to existing studies conducted in developed countries.

Laparoscopic surgery is a procedure where small incisions are made compared of the conventional open surgery that involves large incisions. Despite having the benefit of faster healing and fewer scars, it is very difficult to operate due to tight spaces and awkward positions of the surgeons. To overcome such difficulties, a semi-automated laparoscopic instrument was designed. It features joint articulation and has 4 degrees of freedom (DOF). Verification of the design is needed to tell whether it meets the needed operation specification. In this paper, a design of the joint articulating end-effector with a grasper of laparoscopic instrument was presented. The finite element analysis (FEA) package of CATIA V5 was used for the design analysis. The constraints were determined upon starting the FEA while the connections and contacts between the parts were also determined. Several FEA connection types were determined based on the relationship among the parts. A 5-N force, based on the average human liver weight, was applied to the tip of the end-effector. Results presented the errors of the assembly analysis, Von Mises stress and maximum deformation of the assembly. It was concluded that the design was capable of the 4DOF movements, which are the following: rotation along the axis, 90° shaft bending, grasp clamping action and end-effector rotation.

8666405,Circular economy | Jatropha | Life cycle assessment | Microalgae,1,Gue I.,"© 2018 IEEE. Natural resource extraction have increased three folds during the last four decades. Of which, economic development has been its main driving factor. Ensuring material security and environmental sustainability is of utmost importance for a sustainable economic growth. Circular economy addresses this challenge, via promoting reutilization of a product's components and promoting value durability. It promotes a closed loop economy which reduces virgin resource extraction and promotes recycling. The energy requirement for this economic system will require energy sources of high recycling potential. A good candidate may be found in biofuels, because of its quick reutilization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Currently, one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuels is microalgae. It has the capacity to grow in non-arable land and produce significant amounts of oil per hectare. Several studies have assessed the environmental impact of its production, but none has considered its applicability in a circular economy. In this paper, we propose the frameworks of life cycle assessment and the material circularity indicator by the Ellen MacArthur foundation to assess the applicability of microalgal biodiesel in a circular economy. We utilized the life cycle assessment frameworks in assessing the feedstock's impact to global warming, resource depletion, and bulk waste, while the material circularity indicator is utilized to quantify its reutilization. Comparison was carried out to jatropha biodiesel as a reference feedstock due to its similar popularity.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, it explores the extent to which diversity of connectivity or the connection through multiple internet access points may facilitate online privacy behavior. Second, it explains the diversity of connectivity-online privacy behavior link in terms of information literacy. Design/methodology/approach: Situated in the context of urban poor youth in the Philippines (n = 300), this paper used a quantitative approach, specifically an interview-administered survey technique. Respondents were from three cities in Metro Manila. To test for indirect relationship, survey data were analyzed using bootstrapping technique via SPSS macro PROCESS (Hayes, 2013). Findings: Urban poor youth with diversified connection to the internet engaged in online privacy behavior. The more the youth are connected to the internet through diverse modalities, the more this fosters cautious online privacy behavior. In addition, information literacy explained how diversity of connectivity facilitated online privacy behavior. It suggests that differences in online privacy behavior may result from the extent of basic know-how of navigating online information.

8658952,,0,Yusiong J.,"© 2019 IEEE. Monocular depth estimation is extremely challenging because it is inherently an ambiguous and ill-posed problem. The unsupervised approach to monocular depth estimation using convolutional neural networks is gaining a lot of interest since learning from a set of rectified stereo image pairs without ground truth depths and predicting scene geometry from a single image have become feasible. The proposed approach requires training an encoder-decoder network architecture, referred to as autoencoders in autoencoder (AsiANet), in an unsupervised fashion to discover the implicit relationship between a single image and its corresponding depth map. AsiANet uses a unique Inception-like pooling module based on fractional max-pooling for dimensionality reduction. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture trained using the Charbonnier loss function achieved superior performance on depth map prediction compared to previous unsupervised monocular depth estimation methods.",SCOPUS_ID:85063579520,AsiANet: Autoencoders in autoencoder for unsupervised monocular depth estimation,2-s2.0-85063579520,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-04,10.1109/WACV.2019.00053,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728119755'}]",,,443-451,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063579520,,,cp,Conference Paper

Multiple-target tracking (MTT) is one of the main components of traffic monitoring systems directly responsible for measuring traffic information. However, assessment and evaluation of these vehicle tracking systems greatly varies and are often incomparable due to different metrics and datasets. This paper focuses on comparing and assessing the viability of online multiple vehicle tracking systems for use in real-time traffic monitoring. Most online vehicle tracking framework uses background subtraction for real-time vehicle detection and various blob-based appearance models for real-time multiple vehicle tracking. The results show that commonly used metrics such as multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) and multiple object tracking precision (MOTP) are not necessarily reflective of traffic monitoring performance, particularly in terms of vehicle count accuracy. Furthermore, the track identity switching (IDS) metric is identified to significantly affect the vehicle count accuracy, particularly in terms of count precision, having a correlation coefficient of r(100)=-0.709 with P-value p < 0.001.",SCOPUS_ID:85063535958,Assessment of Vision-Based Vehicle Tracking for Traffic Monitoring Applications,2-s2.0-85063535958,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-04,10.23919/APSIPA.2018.8659455,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9789881476852'}]",,,2014-2021,"2018 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference, APSIPA ASC 2018 - Proceedings",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063535958,,,cp,Conference Paper

Computer vision is an exciting field that integrates soft-computing algorithms and computer hardware powerful enough to handle the computation required especially if it is to be used in real-time applications. Pedestrian detection and tracking is one application of computer vision which is very useful in surveillance applications. Under this application, real-time processing of images to detect human object and perform tracking is carried out. Illumination of the scene is crucial in order the detection algorithm to carry out the computation task correctly. In this study, a computer vision system is developed for the detection and tracking of pedestrian or human body in a video.

In this paper, Advanced Encryption Standard was modified to address the low diffusion rate at the early rounds by adding additional primitive operations such as exclusive OR and modulo arithmetic in the cipher round. Furthermore, byte substitution and round constant addition were appended to the key schedule algorithm. The modified AES was tested against the standard AES by means of avalanche effect and frequency test to measure the diffusion and confusion characteristics respectively. The results of the avalanche effect evaluation show that there was an average increase in diffusion of 61.98% in round 1, 14.79% in round 2 and 13.87% in round 3. Consequently, the results of the frequency test demonstrated an improvement in the randomness of the ciphertext since the average difference between the number of ones to zeros is reduced from 11.6 to 6.4 along with better-computed p-values. The results clearly show that the modified AES has improved diffusion and confusion properties and the ciphertext can still be successfully decrypted and recover back the original plaintext.",SCOPUS_ID:85064106862,Modified AES cipher round and key schedule,2-s2.0-85064106862,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-03-01,10.11591/ijeei.v7i1.652,,,1,28-35,Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064106862,7,,ar,Article
8881980,Cotton Yarns | Saccharum spontaneum Linn. | Talahib | Tensile Strength Test | Wild Cane Grass,0,Santos R.,"© 2019 IEEE. A considerable contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases is the textile industry's production of synthetic fibers due to their use of petroleum products (Laitala, Klepp, & Henry, 2018). Thus, there is a need to discover more cellulosic fibers to help lessen the environmental impact of those synthetic fibers (van Dam, 2008; Laitala, et al., 2018). However, there seems to be a lack of cellulosic fibers and natural yarns in the market, only Agave sisalana (Sisal), Ananas comosus (Pineapple) and commercially available (e.g. Cotton) to be able to replace synthetic fibers (Chadramothan & Marimuthu, 2011). Thus, this research aims to study Saccharum spontaneum Linn., locally known in the Philippines as 'Talahib' and internationally as 'Wild Cane Grass' as an alternative to commercially available synthetic fiber. The researchers produced yarn blends that consist of 30% Saccharum spontaneum (300 g) with 70% pure cotton (700 g) by cutting, drying, blending, and spinning the fibers from the leaves and stalks onto bobbins. In spinning, the fibers passed through four machines-namely: blending machine, draw frame machine, speed frame machine, and ring frame machine. Pure commercial (100%) cotton yarns were obtained from the Philippine Textile Research Institute. Tensile Strength Testing was used in order to determine the strength of the grass prototype yarn compared to pure cotton yarn. The mean breaking strength of the blended yarns were recorded at 3.99 N while the pure cotton yarns were recorded at 2.99 N. Furthermore, using statistical t-test for two sample means assuming unequal variances of the recorded breaking strength of the yarns, a t-critical value of-2.13 and a t stat value of-12.13 were noted. Thus, the researchers concluded that there was probably a significant difference in the strength of the Saccharum spontaneum-cotton blended yarn to the pure cotton yarn. The study tends to suggest that Saccharum spontaneum Linn. may be a likely viable substitute in terms of the strength of the yarn. The researchers recommend that further research should be done to study the feasibility of having a varied percentage blend of Saccharum spontaneum Linn.-Cotton yarns and testing its tensile strength.",SCOPUS_ID:85075030962,Talahib (Saccharum spontaneum Linn.) as Alternative to Commercial Cotton Yarn,2-s2.0-85075030962,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8881980,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,23-25,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075030962,,,cp,Conference Paper

Biochar was one of the solutions to this as it can be made from burning dead plant matter using the process of pyrolysis. The researchers developed 4 variables three being independent and 1 being the control. The experiment lasted a total of twenty six days. After the researchers analyzed the data it was shown that the setup using biochar and organic fertilizer was the most promising out of the 4 groups as the total amount of seeds germinated was 16, then the soil was the healthiest being measured by acidity. With the data gathered there is an observable synergy between biochar and organic fertilizer (Apple based compost). Using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) the soil acidity at α = 0.05, there was not enough evidence to support the claim that there is no significant increase in the acidity of the soil, for biochar group & the biochar with organic fertilizer (apple peel compost).

8882087,Anti-reflective | Layers | Photovoltaic Modules | Silicon Dioxide Coating,0,Bayon J.,"© 2019 IEEE. Due to the negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment, people have been starting to look at renewable energy as an alternative source of power-specifically solar energy (Perkins-Kirkpatrick, & Gibson, 2017; Saboori, Rasoulinezhad, & Sung, 2017; Sturve et al., 2014). Photovoltaic modules are used to harvest energy from the sun by converting solar radiation into electricity. However, the glass on photovoltaic modules, that is used to protect itself from rain and dust, reflects potentially useful light away from the solar cells-thus lowering the amount of transmitted light; this causes the efficiency of photovoltaic modules to drop, making it difficult for people to switch to renewable energy (Ali, Khan, & Jafri, 2014). By layering SiO2 anti-reflective spray coatings on the glass of a photovoltaic module, the researchers would be able to allow more light to transmit into the solar cells, thus increasing the efficiency of the photovoltaic modules.The researchers had six set-ups, one control and five experimental, with different amounts of layers each (single layer to five layers). The power produced by each set-up was measured using a digital multimeter at seventeen time intervals between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on December 6, 2018; the average temperature on that day was 30 degrees Celsius.It was discovered that the photovoltaic module with two layers of SiO2 spray coatings performed the best by having a mean power of 4.34 W, while the photovoltaic module with four layers performed the worst by having a mean power of 2.15 W. Using a two-tailed independent samples t-Test, the researchers found out that the difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group with two layers of coating were not statistically different.Layering SiO2 spray coatings probably improves the efficiency of the module, but the difference is not significant statistically. It is recommended to use an actual SiO2 film to ensure the purity and thickness of the layers.",SCOPUS_ID:85075004413,Layering Silicon Dioxide (SiO<inf>2</inf>) Spray Coatings for Improved Photovoltaic Module Efficiency,2-s2.0-85075004413,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8882087,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,20-21,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075004413,,,cp,Conference Paper
8882054,Diatomite | Food Spoilage | Insulating Materials | Lunchbox | Temperature,0,Estrada A.,"© 2019 IEEE. Most parents make their children packed lunches when they go to school and these packed lunches are usually put in thermal insulated containers or thermal lunchboxes. The insulating material used in these containers are usually insulating foams. However, the commonly used insulating lunchboxes could not preserve the temperature of the food. If the temperature of the food is not maintained properly, bacteria may inhabit the food which could lead to children having foodborne illnesses. Therefore, testing various kinds of containers with different insulating materials is essential (Chu, 2013). To look for another alternative insulating material for lunchboxes, this research will focus on the use of diatomite, an insulating material used in road pavements, in lunchboxes to preserve the temperature of the food. In the experiment, there were two set-ups, one with the diatomite insulated lunchbox and the commercially available insulated lunchbox. The insulating material used by the commercially available lunchbox is foam. Measurements of the temperature were obtained every thirty-six minutes using a thermometer. The means and the standard deviation of each lunchboxes were compared. T-Test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the mean temperatures of the commercially available lunchbox and the lunchbox with diatomite.At alpha 0.05, it could possibly be concluded that there is a significant difference between the means of both lunchboxes. The mean of the diatomite insulated lunchbox is greater than the mean of the commercially available lunchbox. This shows that the diatomite insulated lunchbox tend to be more efficient in preserving the temperature of the food than that of the commercially available lunchbox. The study suggests that diatomite appears to be a more efficient substitute. Furthermore, the researchers recommend to use an advanced technology of thermometer in order to yield more accurate results and to prevent heat loss. The researchers also suggest to use different kinds of lunchboxes with different insulating materials.",SCOPUS_ID:85074998451,Using Diatomite to Enhance the Thermal Storage of Lunchbox,2-s2.0-85074998451,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8882054,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,4-6,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074998451,,,cp,Conference Paper

Dzulkifli, M., & Mustafar, M. (2013) noted that colors help in memory performance. Particular colors aid in cognitive attention and may contribute to academic success. The research aims to study the use of the Subject-Verb Color Wheel in teaching Subject-Verb Agreement to selected Alternative Learning System students. The Alternative Learning System is a government program which allows students who do not have the means to pay for formal schooling to attend an informal school setup based on their available time. The researchers taught several concepts on Subject-Verb Agreement using the color wheel. The color wheel is a learning device composed of two wheels attached to one another by a paper fastener, the wheel contains various examples of the different concepts in Subject-Verb Agreement. The larger wheel has subjects that are in certain colors, while the smaller wheel has the verbs also in matching colors. To be used, the student has to match the colors on both wheels by rotating the inner verb wheel. These color wheels, made by the researchers such that the various concepts of the lesson printed on different colors and students may keep them a reviewer. The post-test was then conducted to determine whether or not the intervention and use of the modified Color Wheel reviewer on the student's test results in comparison with their pretest results. The Quasi-experimental study conducted to explore the result of this study. An independent sample t-test revealed that though the hypothesized value of 0.50 wasn't attained, because it showed a significant 0.23 increase in the grades of the participants after having undergone the intervention and implementation of the modified Color Wheels.

8881985,cogon | compositions | fibers | hyacinth | insulation | thermal,0,Mendoza L.,"© 2019 IEEE. Water hyacinth (E. cressipes), and Cogon Grass (Imperata cylindrica) fibers have long been used for different purposes such as paper, crafts, and insulation because of their abundances as pest plants and the fibers' characteristics (Bhuvaneshwari, 2016; Kassim et al., 2015). Previous studies have investigated and assessed water hyacinth regarding thermal insulation. However, cogon grass has not yet been studied regarding its insulating characteristics. Both plants may be used as eco-friendly materials in replacement of the synthetic fibers used in thermal insulation. In this study, the insulation panels were made in different compositions to test effectivity among the different samples in terms of insulating heat and compatibility among the fibers. Five compositions of panels were made: 100% hyacinth only, 75% hyacinth 25% cogon, 50% hyacinth 50% cogon, 25% hyacinth 75% cogon and 100% cogon. Fibers were obtained by boiling, trimming, and blending the stalks and leaf blades. The panel boards were formed and shaped according to the stipulated ratios in metal trays separated by sheets of aluminum foil. The heat test was conducted under the sun from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm to simulate the heat from the peak of the day's heat on thermal insulation. A heat test, density test, ANOVA, and T-test were conducted. Since the Fcomp value was greater than the critical value, ANOVA results showed that panels with 25% cogon and 50% cogon compositions may have been effective in insulating the heat surrounding them and all were comparatively in line with standard thermal insulation may it be synthetic or hyacinth insulation from other studies. The comparison of hyacinth insulation and all the other panels utilized a two-way t-test, the 50:50 hyacinth-cogon composite was still the best performing panel in insulating heat due to the balance of qualities possessed by cogon and hyacinth fibers. Although this paper shows the compatibility of these natural components as thermal insulation, there may still be many characteristics regarding insulation to be tackled and improved upon.

8881949,calcium carbonate | fire retardant | marine wood | oyster shell | UL 94 Flame Test,0,Atienza R.,"© 2019 IEEE. In the Philippines, fire outbreaks are one of the pre-eminent types of disaster that are involved in multiple human casualties annually. Velasco (2013) reports that fires are the most costly preventable emergencies in the Philippines but are relatively unstudied. The study seeks to alleviate the occurrence of fire-related disasters by evaluating the capacity of the local aquatic species, Crassostrea iredalei (Philippine Cupped Oyster Shells) as composites in the fabrication of a fire retardant coating. The use of oyster shell was taken into consideration, because the material contains approximately 95-98% of calcium carbonate-a material that is recognized to be incombustible (Shah et al., 2014). The research was conducted through the UL 94 vertical flame testing procedure (Ul Standards, 2013). The effectiveness of the synthesized coating was established in terms of their time of burning. The fire retardant coating was fabricated by forming a mixture of the oyster shell powder and the waterborne acrylic resin of different percent mass/volume composition. Brushing method of application was used in applying the coating samples to the wood surface. The gathered mean burning time of the experimental set-ups were 22.67 minutes (25% m/v), 25.00 (50% m/v) and 29.67 minutes (75% m/v); while the wood applied with the resin was recorded in 18.00 minutes. The obtained Pearson value of the experimental set-ups of different percent composition was 0.980306. Using the statistical tests: T-test for two sample means, ANOVA Single Factor, and Pearson Correlation, it was revealed that there was a significant difference in the burning time of the oyster shell-based coating and the waterborne acrylic resin. Furthermore, it was discovered that there may have been a direct correlation between the percent composition of the oyster shell composite and the time of burning of the material. The findings of this study suggest that the material may be potentially used for fireproofing due to the improved thermal degradation of the samples. The researchers further recommend that other factors such as: air moisture, surface material and the angle of ignition that may affect the proliferation of fire be considered to obtain optimum efficiency.",SCOPUS_ID:85074996710,Utilizing Philippine Cupped Oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) Shell Powder and Waterborne Acrylic Resin as a Fire Retardant Coating for Marine Wood,2-s2.0-85074996710,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8881949,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,9-10,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074996710,,,cp,Conference Paper
8882035,extract | larvicide | mosquito larvae | saba banana | tablets,0,Braganza C.,"© 2019 IEEE. Mosquitoes are a major problem around the world, with the diseases they spread being responsible for millions of deaths every year (Kamaraj et al., 2011). Mosquito population may be controlled by reducing the larvae population which may be found in mosquito breeding areas such as stagnant water. Larvicidal properties have been found within certain plant extracts. Fernandes et al. (2014) found that Manilkara subsericea extract has insecticidal properties. A study by Kamaraj et al. (2011) also found that Annona squamosa L., also known as the custard apple, exhibits larvicidal activity against mosquito larvae. In this study, Musa acuminata x balbisiana peel extract was hypothesized to have such properties, possibly due to secondary metabolites within extracts which may affect the digestive system of larvae. The extract was obtained by mixing the peels with 70% isopropyl alcohol. The tablets were formulated by mixing the saba banana peel extract with sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and corn starch. The tablets were made with two different concentrations of the extract, one in 5% concentration and another in 10% concentration. The experiment setup was done by placing the tablets or the commercial larvicide in 100 mL of water with 20 mosquito larvae. The mean of the dead mosquitoes in each group was observed and compared. To compare the data, the t-test for two sample means (two-tailed) was used. It was found that 2 days after application, the experimental tablets were likely less effective than commercial larvicide, however after 3 days, it was found that the 10% extract group was as effective as the commercial larvicide group. The t-tests between the 5% and 10% extract groups showed that the 5% extract group was not able to kill as much larvae. This led to the conclusion that the proposed treatments were possibly effective, especially the tablets of the 10% extract group, although slower than commercial larvicide. Future works may experiment with higher extract concentrations such as 20% and 30% and other extraction methods and may also include an analysis of the chemical composition of the extract and the growth factor rather than the mortality factor of the treatment.",SCOPUS_ID:85074994186,The Development of a Larvicidal Tablet Using Saba Banana (Musa acuminata x balbisiana) Peel Extract,2-s2.0-85074994186,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8882035,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,15-17,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074994186,,,cp,Conference Paper

Lower income families which comprise a majority of the population have limited access to proper healthcare given scarcity of public doctors and high costs of private healthcare. However, first aid knowledge among the public is not common and incorrect treatments can be counterproductive. With these, the researchers developed a mobile application program to provide instructions for health concerns based around the needs of Our Lady of Banneux, a community made by Answering the Cry of the Poor (ANCOP) and Couples for Christ (CFC), using the community's preferred Filipino language. The community is also a partner community of the researchers' school, La Salle Green Hills (LSGH). Before the program was introduced to the respondents, a survey on the community's socio-demographic profile and a medical knowledge test on common health concerns were given. Latter was done to establish the respondents' baseline first aid knowledge. Participants were then divided into control and test groups with their medical knowledge compared. Using a t-test, the findings suggest that the level of medical knowledge between the groups is statistically the same. To see whether any of the respondents' socio-demographic variables has an association with their medical knowledge, a chi-square test of independence was made and it was revealed that, in both groups, there is not enough evidence to conclude that these have an association. The program was then introduced to the test group and a medical appropriateness test was given to both groups.

8882047,,0,Gutierrez M.,"© 2019 IEEE. According to a study published by Crystal & Graddol (1997), English is the most common and utilized language in the world. Regarded as the lingua franca, it is seen in social media, academic texts, novels, television, and more. Due to its omnipresence, it is paramount that every citizen must at least have a decent grasp of the language. However, as stated and shown in the Senate Resolution No. 622 filed by Senator Grace Poe (2018), English proficiency has been on a steady decline (p. 2). Instead of combating this using traditional teaching methods, this paper proposes that teachers instead use the storytelling approach. Studies have shown that stories, when it is aligned with one's interests, have a profound effect on a person's ability to understand the language (Gonzales, 2009, p. 105). This paper will focus on determining which type of storytelling will be more effective in teaching English: traditional or digital. Traditional storytelling is the storyteller-listener approach, while digital storytelling is storytelling using computer-based tools. These two types of storytelling were used to test the English proficiency of 2 different sections from the Adult Night High School (ANHS) students of La Salle Green Hills. Using a pre-test borrowed from the Word-Up project, the researchers were able to assess their initial English proficiency level. Afterwards, the students were asked to read the story 'The Monkey's Paw' by W.W Jacobs, one through traditional reading and the other through PowerPoint presentation. The students were then given a post-test made by the researchers themselves to see if they improved, and if one class scored higher than the other. Using T-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances with a 95% level of confidence, the statistical computations show that there is little to no statistical difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of traditional storytelling class and the digital storytelling class. Hence, researchers have failed to reject the null hypothesis, which means that there is little to no significant difference between the effectiveness of digital storytelling and the effectiveness of traditional storytelling. However, this could be attributed to the limitations of the study. Therefore, more research must be done in order to come to a more conclusive result.",SCOPUS_ID:85074969283,Digital Storytelling vs Traditional Storytelling: Teaching English Language to ANHS Students,2-s2.0-85074969283,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8882047,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728115023'}]",,,38-41,"2019 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074969283,,,cp,Conference Paper

Reconfigurable antennas are antennas designed to have multiple radiation patterns. They utilize omnidirectional antennas and enable them to exhibit directional patterns by integrating parasitic elements to alter the fields produced by the effective aperture and a switching system to enable these elements. In this paper, the switching system was given automation in changing a base station antenna's beam pattern in response to an area's user density that was measured by an Integrated Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID). The setup was connected to an Arduino Mega 1280 programmed for tracking of number of users in an area. After the data was fed to the antenna, another microcontroller compared it from the different setups and directed the beams to the area with the highest user density. The antenna was able to automatically switch its radiation pattern when the number of users in different locations were varied. These antennas are seen useful (1) for deployments in areas with insufficient and unstable power supply and with changing user distribution, and (2) for user's presence tracking in case of emergencies.",SCOPUS_ID:85067939937,Automatic Antenna Beam Selection for Optimal Cellular User Coverage,2-s2.0-85067939937,PCARI,undefined,Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-03-01,10.1109/IWAT.2019.8730624,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538682692'}]",,,169-172,"2019 International Workshop on Antenna Technology, iWAT 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067939937,,,cp,Conference Paper

,Covariance descriptor | Distance constraint | ITML | Metric learning,0,Rivero R.,"Copyright © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers. It has been reported repeatedly that discriminative learning of distance metric boosts the pattern recognition performance. Although the ITML (Information Theoretic Metric Learning)-based methods enjoy an advantage that the Bregman projection framework can be applied for optimization of distance metric, a weak point of ITML-based methods is that the distance threshold for similarity/dissimilarity constraints must be determined manually, onto which the generalization performance is sensitive. In this paper, we present a new formulation of metric learning algorithm in which the distance threshold is optimized together. Since the optimization is still in the Bregman projection framework, the Dykstra algorithm can be applied for optimization. A nonlinear equation has to be solved to project the solution onto a half-space in each iteration. We have developed an efficient technique for projection onto a half-space. We empirically show that although the distance threshold is automatically tuned for the proposed metric learning algorithm, the accuracy of pattern recognition for the proposed algorithm is comparable, if not better, to the existing metric learning methods.",SCOPUS_ID:85069671514,Threshold auto-tuning metric learning,2-s2.0-85069671514,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1587/transinf.2018EDP7145,,09168532,6,1163-1170,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069671514,E102D,,ar,Article
,canonical variate analysis (CVA) | dynamic process monitoring | incipient fault | Kalman filter (KF),0,Pilario K.,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Industrial process monitoring deals with three main activities, namely, fault detection, fault diagnosis, and fault prognosis. Respectively, these activities seek to answer three questions: ‘Has a fault occurred?’, ‘Where did it occur and how large?’, and ‘How will it progress in the future?’ As opposed to abrupt faults, incipient faults are those that slowly develop in time, leading ultimately to process failure or an emergency situation. A recently developed multivariate statistical tool for early detection of incipient faults under varying operating conditions is the Canonical Variate Dissimilarity Analysis (CVDA). In CVDA, a dissimilarity-based statistical index was derived to improve the detection sensitivity upon the traditional canonical variate analysis (CVA) indices. This study aims to extend the CVDA detection framework towards diagnosis and prognosis of process conditions. For diagnosis, contribution maps are used to convey the magnitude and location of the incipient fault effects, as well as their evolution in time. For prognosis, CVA state-space prediction and Kalman filtering during faulty conditions are proposed in this work. By covering the three main process monitoring activities in one framework, our work can serve as a baseline strategy for future application to large process industries.",SCOPUS_ID:85069658658,"Incipient Fault Detection, Diagnosis, and Prognosis using Canonical Variate Dissimilarity Analysis",2-s2.0-85069658658,,undefined,,0,False,B9780128186343502009,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1016/B978-0-12-818634-3.50200-9,,15707946,,1195-1200,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069658658,46,,ch,Chapter

,Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method | Grey systems theory | Multi-criteria decision-making | Oil and gas industry | Supplier selection | Uncertainty,1,Kaviani M.,"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The oil and gas industry is a crucial economic sector for both developed and developing economies. Delays in extraction and refining of these resources would adversely affect industrial players, including that of the host countries. Supplier selection is one of the most important decisions taken by managers of this industry that affect their supply chain operations. However, determining suitable suppliers to work with has become a phenomenon faced by these managers and their organizations. Furthermore, identifying relevant, critical and important criteria needed to guide these managers and their organizations for supplier selection decisions has become even more complicated due to various criteria that need to be taken into consideration. With limited works in the current literature of supplier selection in the oil and gas industry having major methodological drawbacks, the purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated approach for supplier selection in the oil and gas industry. Design/methodology/approach: To address this problem, this paper proposes a new uncertain decision framework. A grey-Delphi approach is first applied to aid in the evaluation and refinement of these various available criteria to obtain the most important and relevant criteria for the oil and gas industry. The grey systems theoretic concept is adopted to address the subjectivity and uncertainty in human judgments. The grey-Shannon entropy approach is used to determine the criteria weights, and finally, the grey-EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution) method is utilized for determining the ranking of the suppliers. Findings: To exemplify the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, this study uses the oil and gas industry of Iran as a case in point. From the literature review, 21 criteria were established and using the grey-Delphi approach, 16 were finally considered. The four top-ranked criteria, using grey-Shannon entropy, include warranty level and experience time, relationship closeness, supplier’s technical level and risks which are considered as the most critical and influential criteria for supplier evaluation in the Iranian oil and gas industry. The ranking of the suppliers is obtained, and the best and worst suppliers are also identified. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the results using the proposed methodology are robust. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach would assist supply chain practicing managers, including purchasing managers, procurement managers and supply chain managers in the oil and gas and other industries, to effectively select suitable suppliers for cooperation. It can also be used for other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) applications. Future works on applying other MCDM methods and comparing them with the results of this study can be addressed. Finally, broader and more empirical works are required in the oil and gas industry. Originality/value: This study is among the first few studies of supplier selection in the oil and gas industry from an emerging economy perspective and sets the stage for future research. The proposed integrated grey-based MCDM approach provides robust results in supplier evaluation and can be used for future domain applications.",SCOPUS_ID:85064012462,An integrated grey-based multi-criteria decision-making approach for supplier evaluation and selection in the oil and gas industry,2-s2.0-85064012462,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1108/K-05-2018-0265,,0368492X,,,Kybernetes,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064012462,,,ar,Article

We investigated the proposition that among international students, face-to-face (FtF) interaction with the host-country network, and Facebook interaction with the host-and the home-country networks predict perceived social support, which, in turn, predicts psychological adjustment. We tested the model using cross-lagged and non-lagged reciprocal effects path analyses on three-wave panel data gathered via online surveys. The results indicated that whereas FtF interaction with the host-country increased perceived social support in the short-term, Facebook interaction with the host-country lowered perceived social support in the long-term. Perceived social support increased Facebook interaction with the host-country both in the short-and the long-term.

11,Impression | Inference | Multimodal interaction | Personality trait,4,Okada S.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. This article proposes a novel feature-extraction framework for inferring impression personality traits, emergent leadership skills, communicative competence, and hiring decisions. The proposed framework extracts multimodal features, describing each participant's nonverbal activities. It captures intermodal and interperson relationships in interactions and captures how the target interactor generates nonverbal behavior when other interactors also generate nonverbal behavior. The intermodal and interperson patterns are identified as frequent co-occurring events based on clustering from multimodal sequences. The proposed framework is applied to the SONVB corpus, which is an audiovisual dataset collected from dyadic job interviews, and the ELEA audiovisual data corpus, which is a dataset collected from group meetings. We evaluate the framework on a binary classification task involving 15 impression variables from the two data corpora.

This study contributes to proposing the improved bird swarm algorithm optimization least squares support vector machine (IBSA-LSSVM) model to predict the remaining life of lithium-ion batteries. By improving the prediction accuracy of the model, the safety and reliability of the new energy storage system are improved. In order to avoid the bird swarm algorithm (BSA) getting into the local optimal solution, the levy flight strategy is introduced into the improved bird swarm algorithm (IBSA), which improves the convergence performance of the algorithm. Hence, this study is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid IBSA-LSSVM model. The following work has been done: (1) test functions are used to test particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution algorithm (DE), BSA and IBSA; (2) the back propagation neural network (BP) model, support vector machine (SVM) model, quantum particle swarm optimization support vector machine (QPSO-SVM) model, BSA-LSSVM model and IBSA-LSSVM model are tested with the B5, B6 and B18 batteries. The following findings are obtained: (1) the five test functions are used to test the PSO, DE, BSA and IBSA algorithms in 20 dimensions, 50 dimensions and 80 dimensions. The results show that the convergence accuracy and convergence stability of IBSA algorithm is higher than those of the other three algorithms; (2) the residual life of B5, B6 and B18 batteries are predicted by the BSA-LSSVM, SVM, QPSO-SVM, BP and IBSA-LSSVM models. The test results show that the root mean square error of the IBSA-LSSVM model for B5 battery is 0.01, the root mean square error for B6 battery is 0.06, and the root mean square error for B18 battery is 0.02.

,Combined stress | Drought stress | Flowering | Grain filling | Heat stress | Marker metabolites | Metabolomics | Rice (Oryza sativa),0,Lawas L.,"© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Background: Rice is susceptible to both drought and heat stress, in particular during flowering and grain filling, when both grain yield and quality may be severely compromised. However, under field conditions, these 2 stresses rarely occur separately. Under well-watered conditions, plants avoid heat stress by transpirational cooling, while this is not possible under drought conditions. Although investigating combined drought and heat stress is clearly more agronomically relevant than analyzing the effects of the single stresses, only a few studies of this stress combination, in particular under field conditions, have been published. Results: Three rice cultivars differing in drought and heat tolerance were grown in the field under control and drought conditions in 3 consecutive years. Drought was applied either during flowering or during early grain filling and resulted in simultaneous heat stress, leading to reduced grain yield and quality. Analysis by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry showed distinct metabolic profiles for the 3 investigated organs (flag leaves, flowering spikelets, developing seeds). The metabolic stress responses of the plants also strongly differed between cultivars and organs. Correlation analysis identified potential metabolic markers for grain yield and quality under combined drought and heat stress from both stress-regulated metabolites and from metabolites with constitutive differences between the cultivars. Conclusions: Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry resolved metabolic responses to combined drought and heat stress in different organs of field-grown rice. The metabolite profiles can be used to identify potential marker metabolites for yield stability and grain quality that are expected to improve breeding efforts towards developing rice cultivars that are resilient to climate change.",SCOPUS_ID:85066061165,Metabolic responses of rice cultivars with different tolerance to combined drought and heat stress under field conditions,2-s2.0-85066061165,MPG,11.7860.7-001.00,Max-Planck-Gesellschaft,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1093/gigascience/giz050,,,5,,GigaScience,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066061165,8,31081890.0,ar,Article

Background: Rice molecular genetics, breeding, genetic diversity, and allied research (such as rice-pathogen interaction) have adopted sequencing technologies and high-density genotyping platforms for genome variation analysis and gene discovery. Germplasm collections representing rice diversity, improved varieties, and elite breeding materials are accessible through rice gene banks for use in research and breeding, with many having genome sequences and high-density genotype data available. Combining phenotypic and genotypic information on these accessions enables genome-wide association analysis, which is driving quantitative trait loci discovery and molecular marker development. Comparative sequence analyses across quantitative trait loci regions facilitate the discovery of novel alleles. Analyses involving DNA sequences and large genotyping matrices for thousands of samples, however, pose a challenge to non−computer savvy rice researchers. Findings: The Rice Galaxy resource has shared datasets that include high-density genotypes from the 3,000 Rice Genomes project and sequences with corresponding annotations from 9 published rice genomes. The Rice Galaxy web server and deployment installer includes tools for designing single-nucleotide polymorphism assays, analyzing genome-wide association studies, population diversity, rice−bacterial pathogen diagnostics, and a suite of published genomic prediction methods. A prototype Rice Galaxy compliant to Open Access, Open Data, and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible principles is also presented.

Biometrics is popular nowadays because of its very useful security applications. There are different biometric technologies but iris recognition system was considered the most reliable since human irises are unique and cannot be forged easily. The study aims to segment ideal and non-ideal iris images with the help of Zuo and Xin Li’s algorithm to determine the most accurate wavelet family and its coefficient for encoding the iris templates using Haar, Daubechies, Biorthogonal and Reverse- Biorthogonal wavelets. Test metrics, like False Rejection Rate (FRR), False Acceptance Rate (FAR), Compression Rate (CR), and Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) were used in evaluating the performance of the system. Based on the results, the algorithm was able to segment ideal and non-ideal iris images, encode the irises and match the irises accurately. Haar was proven as the most accurate iris recognition algorithm while Reverse-Biorthogonal was the better wavelet algorithm image compression.

In the field of biometrics, vascular or vein pattern matching is a technology that analyses the patterns of blood vessels that can be visible on the surface of the hand through near infrared illumination. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) as feature descriptor algorithm for dorsal hand vein recognition. The hardware implementation is a portable and inexpensive image scanning device using Raspberry Pi, 850nm near infrared lights, IR sensitive CCD camera; and OpenCV Libraries as programming platform. Both algorithms are local invariant making it more suitable for dorsal vein patterns because they are resistant to noise and rotation. Images are preprocessed using CLAHE, low pass filter, and morphological operators. Two algorithms are used independently to extract feature points, and finally, Brute Force Matcher and FLANN are used as image classifiers that implements distance calculation between feature points in the image. Independent testing is performed to assess the performance of the two algorithms. Experimental results shows that ORB delivers better performance than SIFT with overall Accuracy rate of 97.22%, Recall of 94.15%, lowest FAR of 0.0662, and FRR of 0.0541.

Emotion Recognition has been a prominent study even before computers had the same computing power as of today. Human's emotions can be recognized through their body language, behavior and, most evidently, from the facial expression of the person. In facial image classification, each facial image can be represented through feature descriptors. Feature descriptors are simplified representations of the facial image that incorporates the essential key facial features. This study determines which feature descriptor will best fit a respective machine learning algorithm to classify facial expressions. Twelve possible combinations of Key Facial Detection, Saliency Mapping, Local Binary Pattern, and Histogram of Oriented Gradient are investigated together with six machine learning classification algorithms thus generating a total of seventy-two models. These will classify the following emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness and surprise. A stratified ten-fold cross-validation is performed for verification on both the CK+ dataset and the locally gathered dataset for »in the wild» image testing.

Sign language is very important for people who have impaired hearing and speaking inabilities. In this work, we present a method to classify RGB images of static letter hand poses in Sign Language using a Convolutional Neural Netowrk (CNN) inspired by Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks (DenseNet). It was further implemented to classify sign languages in real time using a web camera. DenseNet has been widely used for classification tasks due to the advantages it introduces such as alleviating the vanishing gradient-a common problem encountered with deep networks. Since a deep network is proposed to be used for our sign language classification task, this characteristic is useful. Our proposed network was able to achieve an accuracy of 90.3 % which is comparable to other works including those that used depth images in addition to RGB images.

Having updated information about a patient and the storage of such information are problems of importance the health care industry has been trying to address. The health care industry partly solved this problem with the use of Health Information Exchange (HIE) Systems. One of the most useful features of HIE systems is their capability to change the destination of a client's request when a target server is down (automatic fail-over). Nevertheless they have a major flaw in that HIE systems can not modify the target server when the path to the said server is congested. We attempt to address this problem with the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN). Armed with a global view of the network, an HIE system integrated with SDN can modify, not just the path to a target server, but also the chosen target server itself.

Customized local road vehicles (CLRV) in the Philippines have not been tested for crashworthiness and testing of such comes with great amount of resources. These vehicles are used nationwide and creating a baseline for its standardization is a must to ensure safety of the passengers and its cargo. Thereupon, a study on crashworthiness of CLRV structures is imperative. The non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) approach to study crashworthiness was not a popular choice in the past due to technological constraints and the excessive cost it entails in comparison to the other approaches. But with today's technological advancements, FEA modeling and analysis of large-scale structures are processes that can be executed. With that, the FEA Design Center Facility of the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC) was able to evaluate the crashworthiness of the CLRV. In this project, CAD and FEA models were created to simulate the actual crash testing used to evaluate its crashworthiness. The CAD and FEA construction are based on available engineering standards and the simulation aims to investigate the crashworthiness of the CLRV.

8650095,friction | ions | keratin | static electricity | triboelectric effect,0,Tan G.,"© 2018 IEEE. Human hair is considered as waste material in most parts of the world and its accumulation in waste streams causes many environmental problems; it is a material considered useless in most societies. Recent studies proved that human hair has the ability to become charged with the static electricity. Keratin is found in hairs. Since keratin is a good insulator, it makes the charging of hair possible mainly by contact with another material: this phenomenon is said to be Triboelectric effect. Why won't we utilize human hair which almost anyone anywhere in the world have and most of the time treated as wastes? In this study, we collected human hair wastes from different accessible barbershops and salons. We made this possible through the use of the principle of Triboelectric Effect. Hair has charge affinity of +45 and it is said to become highly positively charged material when brought in contact with other materials (which in this prototype is Vinyl tape with charge affinity of-100). Aided by the vinyl tape's chemical characteristics, the hair tends to give up electrons in the process, thus resulting to a significant output of electrical energy. The amount of transferred charge is [+45 nC/J-(-100 nC/J)] = 145 nC/J. Applying a contact force of 25grams in a 2.5cm wide or friction force of 1 millijoule (mJ) per cm2 samples, the charge transferred per cm-2 is 145 nC/J × 0.001 J = 0.145 nC. The prototype works by using a minimal representation of friction to rotate the belt between two customized rollers around; a roller made up of disposed hair and another roller wrapped with vinyl tape. Each sides of the device have a brush of stranded wires placed near the rollers. The brushes then be connected to metal collectors that are collecting the charges and will be fed into a Bridged rectifier circuit to produce a stable output, and will then be stored in a super capacitor. Based on the preliminary experiments undertaken, the results shows that the Input-Output Ratio of hair used to Output Voltage (rms) is 100mg of hair is to 23VRMS. The 100mg of hair roller will lasts for about 4 months with a raw (un-rectified) output voltage of 21.4V accumulated per 5 minutes. There are 43,200 minutes per month, therefore: (43,200 minutes / 5 minutes) × (21.4V) = 8,640V raw output per month. About 288V per day of raw output voltage will be obtained. Since super capacitors are fast charging, approximately about 100V will be stored. Such output shall be optimized and regulated to charge a cellular phone. Imagine the huge quantity of output voltage can be accumulated from a low-cost prototype. 100 percent sure, it has a positive cost-benefit based on the analysis.",SCOPUS_ID:85063207310,Mobile Phone Charging via Utilization of Triboelectric Effect in Harnessing Electrical Energy from Disposed Human Hair,2-s2.0-85063207310,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650095,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,2297-2301,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063207310,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Rice (oryza sativa) is one of the most in demand staple foods in the world because of its versatility in processing and consumption. But due to the ever increasing human population, rice farmers and producers are pressured to produce more from just one to three cropping seasons. Climatic change also affects rice production as well as the heavy use of chemical inputs. These factors contribute to the problems of pest outbreaks and disease attacks to rice. Brown planthoppers (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) are among the outbreak pests of rice that have brought heavy losses in several Asian countries including the Philippines. Its early detection is crucial because this pest is a virus carrier that can cause tremendous yield loss to rice. With this, designing an early warning device is a critical element for BPH pest management system. Image processing is one of the early detection mechanisms proposed in the literature. In this research, an early warning device using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) through Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for BPH detection is being proposed which can be installed in strategic locations in the palay-farm-area under study.

Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concern that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyber-bullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several young adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. It is now the objective of the present study to determine whether both can negatively affect the academic performance of students. This study employed a quantitative approach to determine a possible correlation between mobile game addiction and cyberbullying with student academic performance. A total of eighty-five (85) respondents from National University-Philippines answered two questionnaires through Google Forms, namely, the Game Addiction Questionnaire and Cyberbullying Questionnaire. Convenience Sampling was used to gather the respondents of the two surveys. Both cyberbullying and mobile game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance. However, it can be concluded that those who have been a victim of cyberbullying are most likely to perpetrate or initiate cyberbullying. Other results are further discussed in the paper.",SCOPUS_ID:85063189876,"Exploring Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and its Effects on Academic Performance among Tertiary Students in one University in the Philippines",2-s2.0-85063189876,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650251,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,1859-1864,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063189876,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper
8650518,air quality characterization | AQI | integrated sensors | machine learning | r programming,0,Amado T.,"© 2018 IEEE. One of the biggest environmental problems right now is air pollution. Air quality is needed to be consistently monitored and assessed to ensure better living conditions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses the air quality index (AQI) to standardize the air quality. However, AQI requires precise and accurate sensor readings and complex calculations, making it not feasible for portable air quality monitoring devices. The aim of this paper is to find an alternative way of monitoring and characterizing air quality through the use of integrated gas sensors and building predictive models using machine learning algorithms that can be used to obtain data-driven solutions to mitigate the risk of air pollution. The proposed methodology is implemented by building a prototype for the integrated sensors using DHT 11 temperature and relative humidity sensor, MQ2, MQ5 and MQ135 gas sensors. Five predictive models are developed in the study, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve-Bayesian classifier, random forest and neural network. Results show that the researchers are able to obtain an accuracy of 98.67%, 97.78%, 98.67%, 94.22%, and 99.56% for all the five models respectively, having the neural network to be the best performing model.",SCOPUS_ID:85063239641,Development of Machine Learning-based Predictive Models for Air Quality Monitoring and Characterization,2-s2.0-85063239641,,EPA,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650518,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,668-672,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063239641,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Recent researches on the development and deployment of large-scale wireless sensor networks focus on the reduction of power consumption to increase network lifetime. This entails the development of more efficient hardware and the integration of the multiple components into a single platform; possibly, a system-on-a-chip sensor node platform. This paper focuses on the application of Q-learning to node clustering as an effective technique in reducing power consumption. A hardware implementation of CLIQUE, a Q-learning-based clustering algorithm that enhances the operation and resiliency of the network and improves the energy expenditure of the sensor nodes, is presented. The power consumption of the hardware is recorded to be around 6.4 mW.

Smart farming system using necessary infrastructure is an innovative technology that helps improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production in the country including tomato. Since tomato plant farming take considerations from various variables such as environment, soil, and amount of sunlight, existence of diseases cannot be avoided. The recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for camera-assisted disease diagnosis for tomato. This study developed the innovative solution that provides efficient disease detection in tomato plants. A motor-controlled image capturing box was made to capture four sides of every tomato plant to detect and recognize leaf diseases. A specific breed of tomato which is Diamante Max was used as the test subject. The system was designed to identify the diseases namely Phoma Rot, Leaf Miner, and Target Spot. Using dataset of 4,923 images of diseased and healthy tomato plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases or absence thereof. The system used Convolutional Neural Network to identify which of the tomato diseases is present on the monitored tomato plants. The F-RCNN trained anomaly detection model produced a confidence score of 80 % while the Transfer Learning disease recognition model achieves an accuracy of 95.75 %.

8650383,efficiency | impedance variation | tunable matching network,0,Quezon P.,"© 2018 IEEE. The antenna input impedance is commonly assumed to be constant but in a real scenario, the impedance value is affected by the environment. This impedance variation affects the performance of the RF power amplifier and its parameters: stability, output power, linearity and efficiency. Among the methods that can mitigate the effects of impedance variation to impedance performance, the tunable matching network (TMN) was used because this technique provides the direct compensation by re-matching the mismatched impedance. A power amplifier was designed first in order to observe the variation of its performance with respect to load impedances which have a VSWR value of less than or equal to four and resulted a PAE variation from 35% to 68%. There was a reduction of 10 percent to the highest achievable PAE mainly due to the loss contributed by the varactors use in the TMN. An improvement up to 10 percent is also seen in various loads especially those near the edge of the VSWR = 4 after integrating the TMN. In addition, the lowest possible output power due to impedance variation was increased from 36 dBm to 38 dBm after integrating the TMN. Another set of simulations was done using ideal varactors in the TMN and resulted to a variation in PAE from 65% to 69% with the lowest output power level of 39.4 dBm recorded.",SCOPUS_ID:85063232384,RF Power Amplifier Efficiency Improvement under Antenna Impedance Variation Using a Tunable Matching Network,2-s2.0-85063232384,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650383,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,333-337,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063232384,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for environmental monitoring in a form of a sensor platform is built with individual nodes, called sensors, that accepts analog signals detected from the changes of state in the environment. One of the crucial parts of a WSN is an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which acts as the interface between the environment and the platform. Since the WSN is for environmental monitoring, it is powered by an energy harvesting unit which demands for low-energy consumption on the constituent blocks including the ADC. Implementing a high-resolution converter can mean higher energy consumption and a much accurate digital result, nonetheless, lower resolution converter consumes less energy but still can give correct digital output. This trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption made impact to the researchers to develop a programmable Successive Approximation Register ADC for WSN.

All in all, 5,174 tweets were gathered and in total 3,055 were English and 2,119 were Filipino or Taglish. The data gathered was then saved in an excel file for data labeling. The data collected were annotated as »non-risky» or »risky» by trained Psychologist. Based on the results of the Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier, 65% of the risky labeled data was classified correctly and 35% of the data was misclassified. On the other hand, the classifier was able to classify 91% of the non-risky tweets and only misclassifying 9%. It was found in this study using unigrams and bigrams affect the classifier as it resulted in about 75%-76% cross-validation score. However, further future improvements such as addition of data or the use of other feature transformers are necessary in order to increase the accuracy of the model.",SCOPUS_ID:85063228486,Suicidal Behavior Detection on Twitter Using Neural Network,2-s2.0-85063228486,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650162,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,657-662,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063228486,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper
8650538,,0,Cabrera G.,"© 2018 IEEE. Wireless sensor networks for monitoring and sensing applications have grown steadily in recent years. These applications are composed of swarm of sensor nodes within close proximity. Typical nodes have a limited power supply and the communications block usually has the largest percentage in the total power consumption. Current trends are geared towards low power design and to address this, three gain settings on the main data receiver's intermediate frequency stage was incorporated to the system based on the transmitter and receiver distance range of 1 m to 10 m. A wake-up receiver was also integrated with the main data receiver, taking the role of idle listening as the main receiver is in sleep mode. The main receiver has a sensitivity of-50 dBm to-70 dBm and consumes 4.14 mW of power, while the wake-up receiver has a sensitivity of-50 dBm and consumes 13.73 μW of power. An energy efficiency of 4.1 nJ/bit and 138 pJ/bit are achieved by the main and wake-up receivers, respectively. Up to 90% of power savings can be achieved as long as the main receiver duty cycle does not go beyond 96%. The estimated area of the integrated receiver chip layout is 1.634 sq. mm.",SCOPUS_ID:85063228454,A 2.4 GHz Energy-efficient Short-range Receiver with Wake-up and Multiple Gain Settings for Wireless Sensor Networks,2-s2.0-85063228454,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650538,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,26-31,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063228454,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

The trend in today's technology is continuously evolving and resolving some of the nature's problems through environmental monitoring. Sensor platforms are acquainted to these functions, for it is one of the devices that enables the reading of data from the environment and interprets to a function that allows monitoring. In every sensor platform, a stable clock generator circuit is a necessity to synchronize the input data from the output results and action. A self-correcting clock generator fixes the process, voltage, and temperature variation issues that affect the outputs of almost all clock generator circuit. The Five-stage Prescriptive Model was used to have a proper procedure in designing the clock generator while pairwise comparison chart and decision matrix were used for the evaluation of alternatives. Current starved ring oscillator was the main circuit block that was used as clock generator which produced the desired frequency. Different circuit blocks such as frequency to voltage converter, analog to digital converter, limiter circuit, trimming circuit, and oscillator are put together as the feedback circuit. The clock automatically corrects itself with a frequency variation of ±10% even if the process, voltage, and temperature change. This study focused on having a low power of 1.12mW for the whole circuit, with a voltage supply of 1.2V. It has three different output frequencies, 26MHz, 13MHz, and 1.08MHz, that were obtained using frequency dividers.

In this paper, we present an implementation of indoor localization, where the location of an object is determined without using the outdoor infrastructure of GPS. Various work involving different technologies exist, but the field remains open to a solution which can attain widespread use, in consideration of cost and infrastructure needed for deployment. For our implementation, we localized a common smartphone in an area with many WiFi signals. The main method was through RSS fingerprinting which was able to achieve a mean error of 2.5 m, aside from outliers that drove the error to 16 m. To improve this, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) techniques were leveraged in addition to the WiFi system. Realtime testing showed that the WiFi+PDR system was able to achieve a 2.28 m mean localization error, while it reached 2.62 m for the WiFi-only approach. Finally, a peer-to-peer approach was explored, in which neighboring smartphone peers were treated as pseudo access points to help eliminate the outlier errors that resulted from very similar RSS fingerprints. To measure distance between peers, an acoustic method was employed using 1 KHz sine waves. The Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) was computed between peers, and the readings allowed for coarse estimates in 5-m bins. However, for very noisy environments, this frequency range may cause the acoustic system to be erroneous, possibly driving the error to as high as 18.01 m.",SCOPUS_ID:85063225791,Improving WiFi Indoor Localization Through a Peer-to-Peer Architecture,2-s2.0-85063225791,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650510,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,2060-2065,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063225791,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) provide a wide range of options to expand a proteins biological capabilities. Modifications such as addition of covalent functional groups influence proteins activity state, localization, turnover, and interactions with the other proteins. PTMs potentially have an influence on therapeutic proteins and play critical element on biopharmaceutical drug development. Despite the importance of PTMs in cellular functions, most peptides with PTMs have no known three-dimensional structures. These protein structural prediction pose new set of challenges for peptides with existing PTMs. Protein-peptide docking simulations play an important role in drug discovery. Providing a peptide docking prediction is not feasible for peptides with only known secondary structure. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of a known peptide-protein docking algorithm to be able to handle peptides with existing PTMs. The proposed solution involves truncation of the PTMs in a peptide. We analyze the proposed algorithm by observing the effect of the length of truncation on the peptide sequence to the predicted structure of an existing docking tool CABSdock.

8650062,Differential Power Processing | Maximum Power Point Tracking | Photovoltaic Systems,0,David R.,"© 2018 IEEE. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems often suffer loss in energy harvest due to mismatch caused by different factors such as partial shading or soiling. Increasing the energy harvest by improving efficiency and power processing while maintaining low cost is the goal of Differential Power Processing (DPP). By only processing a portion or difference of power and enabling PV submodules to operate at their local Maximum Power Point (MPP), DPP increases the power harvest and maintains the reliability of the solar module by preventing the occurrence of hotspots. This project is based on the concept of Differential Power Processing on submodular level solar photovoltaic systems using resonant switched capacitor converters (RSCC). Maximum power point tracking was implemented using modified incremental conductance algorithm with windowed current sensing for a precise measurement of small changes in current. The system was simulated to confirm the capability to transfer differential power and track the MPP. Experimental results were able to validate the simulations and were able to deliver up to 92% of the maximum possible power attainable.",SCOPUS_ID:85063216003,Differential Power Processing for Submodule Solar Photovoltaic Systems,2-s2.0-85063216003,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650062,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,1954-1959,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063216003,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

It can operate at its natural resonant frequency to deliver a constant current independent of the load, simplifying the circuit requirements. Operating in that frequency will also give the advantage of soft switching, letting the converter operate at high efficiencies and reduces EMI.

The fuzzy logic systems assist in simplifying large-scale risk management frameworks. For risks that do not have a proper quantitative probability model, a fuzzy logic system can aid model the cause-and-effect relationships, assess the degree of risk exposure and rank the key risks in a reliable way, considering both the available data and experts' opinions. For companies with broad risk exposure, diversified business and operations in multiple geographic regions, the long list of risks that need to be monitored makes in-depth risk analysis excessive, especially when there are entangled relationships among risk factors. Such an analysis could be costly and extremely tedious without the use of a fuzzy logic system. In addition, fuzzy logic systems include rules that clearly explain the linkage, dependence and relationships among modeled factors. It is helpful for identifying risk mitigation solutions. Resources can then be used to mitigate the risks with the highest level of exposure and relatively low hedging cost. This paper studied the application of Fuzzy Logic System Approach in determining the company's value-at-risk and also to assess risk analysis.

A noise-cancelling technique is implemented on the RF envelope detector to minimize the noise due to the circuit components and to obtain a higher signal-to-noise ratio while maintaining its power within tens of microwatts. Compared to other wake-up receivers, this work focused on designing the receiver with reduced system complexity through a single-ended topology and minimized number of circuit components; thus, ultra-low power operation is attained. At 2.4 GHz RF operating frequency, a-50 dBm sensitivity is achieved with 100 kbps data rate.

8650067,encryption | smartwatch | wearable,0,Centeno J.,"© 2018 IEEE. As smartwatches gain more usefulness in daily life, they handle more kinds of sensitive data. However, most of today's smartwatches unsecurely communicate with the user's mobile phone over Bluetooth Low Energy, leaving personal sensitive information vulnerable to security attacks. Due to the size and resource constraints in smartwatches, security features have been largely neglected. We argue that enforcing encryption as a baseline defense on smartwatch communications can be done without causing significant performance degradation and battery drainage. We implemented four different encryption algorithms (AES, Twofish, RSA, and ElGamal) on a smart-watch and evaluated their effects on the device's battery life, memory, CPU utilization, and communication latency. We tested these algorithms on various types of data exchanged between wearables and mobile phones: simple messages, small files, and sensory data. Our experiments show that enforcing any of the encryption algorithms we evaluated has no statistically significant negative impact on the smartwatch's performance and that the performance overhead introduced by these algorithms will not be perceptible to the user.",SCOPUS_ID:85063200648,Performance Analysis of Encryption Algorithms on Smartwatches,2-s2.0-85063200648,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650067,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,162-166,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063200648,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

8650404,Antenna Misalignment | Maritime Communication | Receive Diversity | Selection Diversity | Transmit Diversity.,0,Cruz G.,"© 2018 IEEE. Communication is essential for coastal and rural areas, and providing an alternative method of communication for isolated coves through maritime communications is a way to cater that need. In order to create a reliable communication system, antenna misalignment attributed to wave motion of the sea must be accounted for because losses in transmission and reception occur. The scope of this study covers the angular variation of wave motion, particularly the roll angle tilting an antenna experiences. In this paper, improvements of using diversity techniques for a 2.4 GHz communication link in the maritime environment were investigated. In particular, spatial diversity, which uses independent multiple antennas to achieve a level of performance one antenna could not, was employed. The use of selection diversity, a type of spatial diversity that selects the antenna branch with the best signal strength, to compensate antenna misalignment is considered and analyzed. A transmitter and receiver front-end incorporating selection diversity were designed and implemented. Results prove that the use of the proposed scheme increase the overall gain of the communication link. There is an average of 1.35 dB and 5.3 dB increase for 2 and 3 antennas respectively, in using receive diversity compared to no diversity, and an average of 2.4 dB increase in using 3 antenna transmit diversity as opposed to no diversity, all of which were exposed to continuous tilting conditions. The presented plots exhibit a general trend showing that selection diversity reduces the received signal strength fluctuations to lower power, and minimizes the losses due to antenna misalignment.",SCOPUS_ID:85063197943,Compensation of Antenna Misalignment Using Selection Diversity for Maritime Communications,2-s2.0-85063197943,,undefined,Commission on Higher Education,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650404,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,350-355,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063197943,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

8650547,DC-DC converters | hybrid power converter | linear regulator | output voltage | power efficiency | switching regulator,0,Yu K.,"© 2018 IEEE. DC-DC converters are used to convert and regulate voltages depending on the requirement of the specific load. There are two types of DC-DC converter: (1) linear regulators and (2) switching regulators. A linear regulator has a small output voltage ripple but its power efficiency degrades when the difference between the input voltage and output voltage increases. On the other hand, the switching regulator has better power efficiency compared to the linear regulator. The switching regulator can convert wide range of input voltages while maintaining high power efficiency and it can also step-up voltages which a linear regulator cannot. The drawback for switching regulator is the need for control circuit that controls the switches and regulation. The switching regulator has also the problem of relatively larger output voltage ripple, which is not suitable for sensitive circuits. In this paper, a hybrid topology was proposed to combine the advantages of the two DC-DC converters. From the simulation of the three converters, the linear regulator only has an efficiency of 28.058% while the switching regulator and hybrid power converter have efficiencies of 49.0881% and 45.6753%, respectively. In addition, input voltages from 0.5V to 5V were tested on the three regulators that would result in a regulated output voltage of 1V. The linear regulator can only regulate voltages above 1V and the PMOS transistor used has a operating voltage of 2.5V which limits the upper voltage boundary of the linear regulator to 3.5V. The switching regulator can regulate wider range of input voltages but due to power loss across the converter, the switching regulator cannot produce a constant output voltage of 1V when the input voltage ranges from 0.5V to 0.7V.

One of the predominant cause of the diminishing productivity of the Philippines that affects its residents and industry sectors alike is no other than the unresolved traffic. Numerous efforts have been implemented in the country to regulate traffic including road expansion, highway development and application of several traffic schemes. One of the research thrust being studied is the solution to the limitation of traditional traffic light systems. Existing literatures in traffic light system embarked on intelligent transportation system (ITS) that is typically based its operation on real-time traffic density data, however implemented in limited control. This paper discussed an approach in developing traffic signaling system capable of prioritizing congested lanes based on real-time traffic density data and integrated with an automated and manual control ported in a mobile android-based application. The system worked with CCTV cameras positioned at every lane of the intersection for the acquisition of traffic images transmitted to the Raspberry Pi 3 microcontroller for traffic density calculation using image processing. It utilized a traffic monitoring system and traffic lights operation control via a mobile android-based application. The system was tested and yielded an average of 92.83% and 85.77% vehicle detection rate for daytime and nighttime respectively. Moreover, an overall system reliability of 92.82% and 85.77% were obtained during daytime and nighttime testing based on the android GUI, lane prioritization and traffic light response. Future work involved integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) on the traffic light system for a wider scope interconnected implementation.",SCOPUS_ID:85063188183,Intelligent Traffic Light System Using Computer Vision with Android Monitoring and Control,2-s2.0-85063188183,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650084,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,2461-2466,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063188183,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

For effective mitigation of disaster crisis, response must be synchronized, quick and suitable, and for an organization such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines who carries out Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (AFP-HADR) operations, the concept of resilience is indeed imperative. Resilience has been defined as the ability of a system faced with disruption to absorb, adapt, recover and convert the impact in an efficient way, while maintaining its required functionality. Correspondingly, Resilience Engineering (RE) is the design methodology for resilience, looking at how a system function through recognition, measurement and improvement of resilient work. To this end, this study presents a mixed methods approach to assess organizational resilience in the military disaster response sector based on RE using fuzzy logic and manifest-latent content analysis.

8650115,Coarse-Fine SAR ADC | Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) | Schreier Figure of Merit (FoMs) | SNDR,0,Agub U.,"© 2018 IEEE. Energy consumption is very critical for environmental monitoring using wireless sensor networks, thus, every block must be designed to consume low energy to be within the limited energy budget of a sensor node. In the context of improving the power efficiency of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), for this specific application, successive approximation register (SAR) ADC is the best architecture to use. In addition, coarse-fine technique has been proven to reduce power consumption in SAR ADCs. However, design considerations involving the coarse ADC bit allocation are important but not discussed in literature. These includes the following: trade off between resolution of the coarse stage and the accuracy of the ADC; trade off between the energy consumption, accuracy and speed of the comparator block; and trade off between energy consumption and accuracy of different switching schemes for the digital-to-analog (DAC) block. This project produced models of these trade-offs, provided a methodology in designing coarse-fine SAR ADCs, implemented two ADCs in the schematic level: the one with the lowest energy consumption; and the one with the highest Schreier figure of merit (FoMs), and implemented the ADC with the lowest energy consumption in the layout level. Optimization using the MATLAB model in the DAC lead to k = 4 which gives the lowest power and k = 3 which gives the highest Schreier FoM. Schematic implementation at 50kSps of k = 4 and k = 3 gave: 2.201pJ and 2.3617pJ switching energy; 9.2 and 9.3 ENOB; and 170.96 dB and 170.72 dB Schreier FoM, respectively. This project was also able to match the trends of the models to the simulations although there are deviations of values. However, ENOBs fall within the target range of ENOBs.",SCOPUS_ID:85063186604,A Study on Coarse Stage Bit Allocation to Improve Power Efficiency of a 10-bit Coarse-Fine SAR ADC Implemented in 65nm CMOS Process for Environmental Sensing Applications,2-s2.0-85063186604,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650115,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,1352-1356,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063186604,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper
8650117,,0,Galila Cabigao N.,"© 2018 IEEE. Video encoding has different methods and techniques in its implementation. Hardware implementations of video encoding systems are usually limited to a single set of compression techniques because of the trade-offs in area and power consumption. A workaround for this is through reconfigurable hardware devices such as the FPGA. The aim of this work is to use an FPGA to extend the set of compression techniques of an available video encoding system by changing the number of intra-prediction modes and motion estimation algorithm. Additionally, since the base system only caters to intra-prediction, an architectural design for the inter-prediction module with full-pixel resolution has been accomplished. The addition of intra-prediction modes showed a very minimal decrease in the total encoding time. This, however, showed 0.44% increase in the resource utilization. The different search algorithms used manifested the expected highest to lowest execution time respectively. The trade-off of higher PSNR versus longer encoding time was shown. An average of 76.96% decrease in execution time was observed while achieving a 0.27% decrease in PSNR.",SCOPUS_ID:85063186387,Design of Multiple Prediction Complexity Configurations for an FPGA-Based H.264 Baseline Profile Encoder,2-s2.0-85063186387,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-22,10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650117,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538654576'}]",21593442,,1727-1732,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063186387,2018-October,,cp,Conference Paper

Monitoring environmental parameters in aquaponics is essential to sustain healthy living conditions for both fish and plants. In order to maximize growth for both, an optimal balance of environmental parameters present in the system is necessary. As a solution, an automated aquaponics system that reacts to parametric changes with an integrated web interface is developed. The Arduino microprocessor sends measured parameters to a central node which host a local server to store the data. Acquired data is processed and triggers corresponding actuators to maintain the optimal environmental parameters. All information are displayed in a mobile-friendly web application which enables access to the real-time and historical data, and manual controls of the actuators. Results shows that the calibrated sensors can gather sensor parameters with high accuracy through comparisons with commercial sensor readings. The control system is capable of running actuators automatically as a result of changes in sensor parameters or manually by the user. Each actuator was tested and successfully triggered for a set period of time for both manual and automated controls. Finally, the network backbone can transmit information and host a website that displays live sensor data, manually control the actuators, and save sensor reading logs. Sensor data are updated and are presented to the user every half seconds which ensures that the data presented are updated. A web application is also uploaded to Heroku which allows the user to view sensor logs and manually control the actuators anywhere.

,Content delivery m-commerce | India,2,Pandey S.,"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of factors derived from the unified theory of user acceptance of technology (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, age, gender) and of those drawn from literature (perceived risk, perceived enjoyment and innovativeness) on the adoption of m-commerce in India. It also suggests implications of these for the consumer behavior theory practitioners and marketers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using an online survey from 321 respondents, split into two groups (high and low adoption level users) based on the usage scores of the four categories of m-commerce- location-based, transaction-based, entertainment and content delivery. Logistic regression technique was used to identify the prominent factors among the nine identified influencers to understand the differences between the two groups. Findings: The findings of this paper are sample biasness, self-reported m-commerce adoption level, limited m-commerce categories and specific context. Research limitations/implications: Except the two factors of performance expectancy and facilitating conditions, all other variables discriminate between low and high adoption levels of m-commerce services in India. Social influence, perceived enjoyment and innovativeness were the three main factors that were found to have the most significant impact on the discrimination levels of m-commerce service users in India. Further, it was found that women and the younger generation users of m-commerce showed a greater propensity for adopting m-commerce practices.

8636333,IPVS | QoS | SDN | Video streaming | Video surveillance,0,Go S.,"© 2018 IEEE. IP video surveillance (IPVS) systems, unlike traditional analog-based systems, are capable of operating over pre-existing computer networks. As a consequence, resource contention among the video streams from multiple IP cameras and traffic from other applications can significantly degrade the overall performance of the underlying network. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a relatively new paradigm which aims to build programmable and flexible networks. By separating forwarding and control functions, the centralized SDN controller can create a map of the network topology by relying on the information provided by the switches. This paper proposes an SDN-based framework to enhance the performance of IPVS systems deployed over underprovisioned networks. In order to assist the controller's rerouting and bitrate adjustment decisions, a video quality indicator was also formulated by using the FlowStats messages queried from the switches via OpenFlow, a widely recognized protocol in SDN. Moreover, our framework is designed based on the observation that the video streams in surveillance systems offer varying utilities depending on the captured event. Experimental results show that employing the proposed solution reduced the video streams' average packet loss, latency and jitter by 87%, 11%, 7%, respectively and also increased throughput by 8%. Furthermore, the comparison of the video streams' QoS metrics suggests that the proposed solution can prioritize the reception of selected streams.",SCOPUS_ID:85063689608,An SDN-based framework for improving the performance of Underprovisioned IP video surveillance networks,2-s2.0-85063689608,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-05,10.1109/I-SPAN.2018.00033,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538685341'}]",,,154-161,"Proceedings - 2018 15th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms and Networks, I-SPAN 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063689608,,,cp,Conference Paper

Blood cells both white and red are important part of the immune system. These cells help fight infections by attacking bacteria, viruses, and germs that invade the body. White blood cells originate in the bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream, while red blood cell helps transport oxygen to our body. Accurate counting of those may require laboratory testing procedure that is not usual to everyone. Generating codes that will help counting of blood cells that produce accurate response via images gives a relief on this problem. In this study, the images were processed and a blob detection algorithm was used to detect and differentiate RBCs from WBCs. A cell counting method was also used to provide an actual count of the RBCs and WBCs detected. The automation comes with a graphical user interface backed-up with a working database system to keep the records of the users (e.g. patients, respondents). The performance of the system was statistically described as accurate compared to the manual method of counting. Results show an accuracy of 100% for platelet, 96.32% for RBCs and 98.5% for WBCs. Hence, the proposed system can benchmark with the manual methods of detection and counting of platelets, RBCs and WBCs in blood samples.",SCOPUS_ID:85063267607,Blood Cells Counting using Python OpenCV,2-s2.0-85063267607,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-02,10.1109/ICSP.2018.8652384,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538646724'}]",,,50-53,"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063267607,2018-August,,cp,Conference Paper
900,Agronomic efficiency | Molecular markers | Nutrient use efficiency | Partial factor productivity | Quantitative trait loci (QTLs),3,Jewel Z.,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. T. The development of rice cultivars with nutrient use efficiency (NuUE) is highly crucial for sustaining global rice production in Asia and Africa. However, this requires a better understanding of the genetics of NuUE-related traits and their relationship to grain yield. In this study, simultaneous efforts were made to develop nutrient use efficient rice cultivars and to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing NuUE-related traits in rice. A total of 230 BC1F5 introgression lines (ILs) were developed from a single early backcross population involving Weed Tolerant Rice 1, as the recipient parent, and Hao-an-nong, as the donor parent. The ILs were cultivated in field conditions with a different combination of fertilizer schedule under six nutrient conditions: minus nitrogen (–N), minus phosphorus (–P), (–NP), minus nitrogen phosphorus and potassium (–NPK), 75% of recommended nitrogen (75N), and NPK. Analysis of variance revealed that significant differences (p < 0.01) were noted among ILs and treatments for all traits. A high-density linkage map was constructed by using 704 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 49 main-effect QTLs were identified on all chromosomes, except on chromosome 7, 11 and 12, which are showing 20.25% to 34.68% of phenotypic variation. With further analysis of these QTLs, we refined them to four top hotspot QTLs (QTL harbor-I to IV) located on chromosomes 3, 5, 9, and 11. However, we identified four novel putative QTLs for agronomic efficiency (AE) and 22 QTLs for partial factor productivity (PFP) under –P and 75N conditions. These interval regions of QTLs, several transporters and genes are located that were involved in nutrient uptake from soil to plant organs and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Further, the validation of these potential QTLs, genes may provide remarkable value for marker-aided selection and pyramiding of multiple QTLs, which would provide supporting evidence for the enhancement of grain yield and cloning of NuUE tolerance-responsive genes in rice.",SCOPUS_ID:85061989670,"Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with nutrient use efficiency traits, using SNP markers in an early backcross population of rice (Oryza sativa L.)",2-s2.0-85061989670,DOST,OPP1130530,Department of Science and Technology,1,True,,Journal,2019-02-02,10.3390/ijms20040900,,16616596,4,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061989670,20,30791412.0,ar,Article

For Internet voting to become more acceptable to voters, it must satisfy both privacy and verifiability. However, a problem with most current Internet voting systems is they need to trust a third party to store and tally the votes. This need to trust a third party risks the privacy of the votes in the event that the third party becomes malicious. One way to eliminate the need to trust a third party is through secure multiparty computation (SMC). In SMC, a vote is secretly-shared among multiple non-colluding parties. These parties also jointly tally the votes. Since no single party has the copy of all the parts of a vote, it will be impossible for a single party to learn about a vote. With Sharemind SDK, the development of an application system that uses SMC becomes easier.

,Corpus building | Data and web mining | Information retrieval | Lexicography,0,Sagum R.,"© 2019 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology. The paper discusses the approach in creating a Filipino WordNet. A semi-supervised learning approach using Decision Tree and Language Modeling. This will take advantage on the information found on the web. It will help future NLP researchers in Filipino language. The approach uses words from a dictionary as preliminary data and as seed for the search engine to start crawling the WWW. To decide if the word is part of Filipino language, the word will first undergo in Code-Switching Points Module (CSPD). CSPD scores the word by using the frequency counts of word bigrams and unigrams from language models which were trained from an existing and available corpus. After scoring, Filipino Stemmer will get the stem of the word and examine if the stem word is part of the said language. Once the words were scored and stemmed, the archive will evaluate if the word is Filipino. To test the accuracy of the system, we collected different articles around the web and then grouped it into two groups - Plain Filipino and Bilingual. The result shows the F-measure for Plain Filipino Category range between 65.65% - 96.85% with an average of 85.64% while for Bilingual range between 60% - 100% with an average of 88.17%.",SCOPUS_ID:85061319684,FICOBU: Filipino WordNet construction using decision tree and language modeling,2-s2.0-85061319684,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-02-01,10.18178/ijmlc.2019.9.1.772,,,1,103-107,International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061319684,9,,ar,Article
,Convergence | Divergence | IRR | Newton-Raphson algorithm | Root-finding algorithm,1,Pascual N.,"© 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication. All rights reserved. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the most compelling performance metric among measures for profitability of investments. The most efficient way to estimate it is by using iterative methods, four of the most popular of which are false position, bisection, secant and Newton-Raphson algorithms. Although Newton-Raphson method is the quickest among them, it does not, however, converge to the root if the user’s guess initial input value is far from the true value of IRR. This study proposes an enhancement that gets rid of such user’s guess input and makes input automatically generated, improves accuracy, lessens the number of iterations and shortens the runtime. The study finds that said enhancement, indeed, does not require user guess input and allows the algorithm to converge to the root with higher accuracy, fewer iterations and shorter runtime.",SCOPUS_ID:85075815089,Enhanced newton-raphson algorithm in estimating internal rate of return (IRR),2-s2.0-85075815089,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-02-01,,,,3 Special Issue,389-392,International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075815089,8,,ar,Article

This study predicted success in The Licensure Examinations for Teachers (LET) applying C4.5 decision tree algorithm. This system was eyed to help the students and the academia improve their success rates in the LET. The following were the academic areas considered: Entrance examination raw scores; general weighted average (GWA) in the major field of specialization and in professional education and general education subjects; and, whether pass or fail in LET review results as well as LET Board results. There were a total of 348 instances studied, spread over a 5-year period, from 2012 to 2017. The size of the C4.5 pruned tree totaled to 16 with 10 leaves. The predictive capacity of the system was found to be almost perfect, evidenced by the generated Kappa value of 0.8195. Therefore, should there be any predicted failure, the teachers and deans could promptly provide intervention programs to improve the scores and GWA of students, which would eventually redound to the success in the LET. This study was conducted at Aklan State University (ASU), (Philippines), because at current times, there is still no academic analytics system installed for this purpose.

The Philippine Congress has signed the House Bill 1022 which declares that the Baybáyin script will be considered as the national writing system of the country. The Department of Education, National Commission for Culture and Arts, and some other organizations have vowed to reintroduce this writing system back. This handwriting system is not taught in the schools anymore so an easier training solution is needed. To be able to make this transition easier and faster, a neural network is proposed to convert hand-drawn characters to its corresponding English alphabet syllabication. The type of neural network used in this study is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To gather the necessary number of training images for the neural network, 25 people were employed to draw the characters. All of them used an Android mobile app that will let them draw their own version of a character based on three characters presented to them. All of the contributed handwritten characters are manually viewed to ensure the quality of the sample data. After testing five different LSTM networks, the model with 512 and 256 units in the hidden layers and 128 units in the dense layer is the best model for classifying hand-drawn Baybáyin characters. All of the models are tested up to 50 epochs. Using 8500 images for training and 1200 images for validation, this model has achieved a 95.6% training accuracy and 92.9% validation accuracy.",SCOPUS_ID:85072950394,LSTM neural networks for baybáyin handwriting recognition,2-s2.0-85072950394,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-02-01,10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821789,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781728113227'}]",,,62-66,"2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2019",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072950394,,,cp,Conference Paper

However, estimating pollen viability is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task for researchers. Moreover, it is difficult to evaluate a large dataset of microscopic images as most of it needs to be meticulously examined. Existing methods have been developed to efficiently estimate total pollen count but their success in computing viability percentage is rather limited since they do not integrate viability testing techniques such as pollen staining. Some of these existing methods greatly depend on features such as the diameter of the pollen grain which requires a manual standardization to come up with two exclusive distributions for viable and nonviable pollen grains. An image analysis protocol was presented to compute the viability percentage on selected genotypes of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The effectiveness of the segmentation was evaluated in terms of accuracy in classification of the pollen grains.

Community detection is one way of extracting insights from voluminous Twitter data. Through this technique, Twitter users can be grouped into different types of communities such as those who interact a lot, or those who have similar sentiments about certain topics. However, most works do not utilize tweet content and simply use directly available information like Twitter follows. Hence, this work explores the incorporation of hashtags and sentiment analysis (also taking into account conversational context) in the input graph for community detection through various schemes. Evaluation was performed by investigating the modularity score, topic similarity/variety, and sentiment homogeneity of the resulting communities. Results suggest that when compared to a baseline graph based on mentions, a scoring approach is more likely to yield a different set of communities compared to the more popular edge-weighting approach.

The exchange of information between vehicles and highway infrastructure also known as vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications has been viewed as one solution to lessen some of the problems in transportation. Currently, V2I communication uses ITS band of 5.9 GHz frequency which is more susceptible to attenuation and has propagation coverage limitation. Over the past years, the use of Television white space (TVWS) has gained popularity because of its superior propagation characteristics due to its low operating frequency. In this study, V2I communications in the TVWS spectrum using the IEEE 802.11af compliant devices has been implemented at the campus of the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, Philippines and evaluated in terms of received signal strength (RSS), throughput and packet loss rate as a function of the modulation coding scheme used. The calculated path losses were modeled as log-normal shadowing and path loss exponents between 3.05 to 3.63 were obtained. At a transmit power of 20 dBm coupled with a 14.3 dBi-12-ring Yagi antenna under line of sight scenario, a 3.76 Mbps throughput was achieved at the receiver end that used a 3 dBi omnidirectional antenna. There was a 15% reduction in throughput observed in non-line of sight scenario caused by multipath propagation influenced by trees, vegetation, and buildings present between the transmitter and the receiver.

In recent years, the complexity and scale of compliance requirements has grown significantly due to globalization as well as maturing of different fields and regulations. However, there remains a gap between compliance management tools and security management tools whereby the later cannot be directly linked to the former as the focus and terminologies used are very different. The tasks of mapping security implementations to compliance requirements that will allow compliance monitoring and management is therefore performed manually and repeatedly across multiple standards, regulations, and organizations. This process is highly inefficient, costly, and does not allow for management to determine compliance levels and gaps in a continuous and automated manner. In this paper, we present an approach that combines ontology mapping, natural language processing, secure systems development lifecycle, and heuristics to allow for mapping of security controls and activities to compliance documents such as standards and regulations to focus on compliance and support continuous compliance management and monitoring as well as reduce the compliance efforts needed in multiple standards compliance by allowing reusability via conceptual mapping of multiple standards and requirements. Practices such as unit testing and continuous integration from secure systems development life cycle are also incorporated to allow for flexibility of the automation process while at the same time using it to support the mapping between compliance requirements.",SCOPUS_ID:85062714852,Towards Compliance Management Automation thru Ontology mapping of Requirements to Activities and Controls,2-s2.0-85062714852,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-25,10.1109/CR.2018.8626817,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538675410'}]",,,,"Proceedings of the 2018 Cyber Resilience Conference, CRC 2018",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062714852,,,cp,Conference Paper

,Hotspot guessing attacks | Passmatrix | Random grid traversal method | Shoulder-surfing attacks,1,Songcuan J.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. In today’s fast paced growing technologies, user authentication plays a crucial role in the protection of data and private information from varied system attacks. Graphical-based password techniques have been proposed as a potential alternative to resolve security and usability limitations. However, most of the existing graphical password schemes like PassMatrix are vulnerable to random guess attacks based on hot-spot analyzing whereas some pass-images are relatively easier to guess because they are more memorable, obvious or unique. To overcome this problem, the researchers proposed the Jumbled PassSteps method. By replacing the single discretized image of the PassMatrix method into several independent images and applying a random grid traversal method, attackers cannot easily guess the original pass-image of the user even if they observed the log-in session. Because the acquisition of the one-time grid traversal steps is done with the use of earphones, the direction and number of traversals to be done in a particular session cannot be acquired by attacker even if it is camera recorded. Experimental results show that Jumbled PassSteps effectively overcomes hotspot guessing attacks and achieves better resistance to shoulder-surfing attacks.",SCOPUS_ID:85064744042,Jumbled passsteps: A hotspot guessing attack resistant graphical password authentication scheme based on the modified passmatrix method,2-s2.0-85064744042,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-19,10.1145/3309074.3309099,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366182'}]",,,55-59,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064744042,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Competition | Cooperation | Equilibrium points | Hill-type function | Modeling | Species | Stability,0,Tabornal R.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.,. Competition and cooperation play an important role in society. It drives the species to survive and it enables to balance and maintain the biodiversity in communities. These concepts are important in many fields, such as in ethology, economics, ecology, and evolutionary theory. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the population of a species that simultaneously interact with a competitor and/or with a cooperator. This modeling study uses a Hill-type function rather than the classical Lotka-Volterra equations. Numerical simulations are done on this model. Heat maps are used to describe different cases by varying the competition coefficient δ and cooperation coefficient γ. Our model has demonstrated not just coexistence but also exclusion or extinction of the population of species. This means that even if competition and cooperation are done simultaneously by a species, it is not a guarantee that they will always survive in the long run. It depends on how much the strength of competition and cooperation they exerted towards its co-competitor or co-cooperator. Moreover, cooperating species are most likely to survive as compared to the competing species. This modeling study enables us to look possibly for ways to control δ and γ, and consequently, control populations in our ecosystem. This will be useful not only for biologists and ecologists but also for researchers who are interested in studying the competitive and cooperative interactions of species in societies.",SCOPUS_ID:85063587792,Mathematical modeling on competition and cooperation of species using hill-type function,2-s2.0-85063587792,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-16,10.1145/3307363.3307378,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366199'}]",,,8-18,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063587792,,,cp,Conference Paper

This is a research-in-progress of developing a coffee eco-market with online bidding for different coffee stakeholders in selected provinces in the Philippines. The objective of this paper is to compare three different forecasting models using a five-year coffee production data. The three models explore and assess exponential smoothing, moving average, and regression. Different components such as seasonal, trend and irregular components are present in the data. Thus, the original data is adjusted by removing the seasonal component, trend component, and irregular component. For the computation of the forecasted values, the MS Excel data analysis tool is used. The standards used to measure the accuracy of each three model for comparison are the MAE, the MSE, and the MAPE. Among the three model, the moving average model rank first with a 9% error accuracy percentage, the next is the exponential smoothing with 12% error accuracy percentage, then the last is the regression with 14% error accuracy percentage.",SCOPUS_ID:85061903861,Assessment of Predictive Models for Coffee Production in the Philippines,2-s2.0-85061903861,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-14,10.1109/ICTKE.2018.8612336,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781538671573'}]",21570981,,25-30,International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061903861,2018-November,,cp,Conference Paper

Nickel oxide and Sc-doped ZrO2 electrode material with a 1:1 wt % composition of NiO and Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 was synthesized via a single-step glycine-nitrate combustion method. Different glycine to nitrate (g/n) molar ratios of 0.27, 0.54, and 1.1 were used to investigate its effect on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of the heat-treated samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-sintered samples for all the g/n ratios were indexed to cubic phases of NiO and ScSZ. Upon reduction at 700 °C, NiO was fully reduced to Ni. In-situ XRD patterns showed that the composite Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 electrode material retains its cubic structure at intermediate temperatures from 500 °C to 800 °C. High magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that nanoparticles of Ni are also formed and situated at the surfaces of ScSZ grains, apart from agglomerated submicron particles of Ni. SEM and electron-dispersive spectroscopy mapping revealed interconnected grains of ScSZ oxide-ion conducting phase. From the calculated conductivity based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, the 0.27 g/n ratio showed an order of magnitude-higher total conductivity among the other prepared samples.",SCOPUS_ID:85059980438,Morphology and structure of Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 electrode material synthesized via glycine-nitrate combustion method for solid oxide electrochemical cell,2-s2.0-85059980438,,IIID-2015-09,Centre for Engineering Research and Development,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-13,10.3390/app9020264,,,2,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059980438,9,,ar,Article

Robotics technology is considered as a new learning program in the teaching and learning of science, particularly in STEM education. The creation of Robotics Program at the De La Salle Santiago Zobel (DLSZ) school, and its integration to the curriculum prompted the researchers to come up with an assessment on how the students perceive their level of creativity and innovativeness in doing robotics. This descriptive study involved elite members of the robotics team from Grade 4-12 (n=46) who served as the respondents to the 7-item selfevaluation instrument adopted by the researchers. Results from this study revealed that the students perceived their level of creativity and innovation in terms of the Process to be at level 3 which is tagged as 'Standard' and described as proficient level of student performance. Also, under Product Design, their perceived level of creativity and innovation was Standard with Value having the highest mean (3.43). The relationship between the students' perceptions on the Process and the Product Design of their robotics outputs proved to be significant (r=.686) at p = .01. While the levels of creativity and innovation among the elite members of the DLSZ robotics was described at the Above Standard level. Interestingly, students' sex and grade levels were found to be not significant to their perceived creativity and innovation levels.

Web-based learning tools have been burgeoning over the past years and continuously shape instructional strategies that will stimulate students' learning. Among these tools, asynchronous discussion forum (ADF) has been a powerful tool to invite reflection among students. However, there are substantial considerations in integrating ADF, specifically in mathematics courses, which will support desired learning outcomes. This study was designed under the paradigm of action research to investigate the learning experiences and challenges of preservice math teachers in answering open-ended questions via ADF. Thirty-four preservice math teachers were divided into four sub-groups, were given a problem to discuss with, and were asked to assess their experience in the conduct of ADF. Based on the structured interview, ADF supports reflection among students while challenging their minds to think critically and be understanding of others' perspectives. It also revealed that the availability of computers and the internet connection remained to be a main challenge among the participants. Further, results showed that the type of questions given to the students served as their foundation in reflecting and thinking critically while the role and the level of participation of the instructor in ADF as well as students' motivation influence the quality of the discussion.",SCOPUS_ID:85064520768,Asynchronous discussion forum: Fostering reflection among preservice math teachers,2-s2.0-85064520768,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-10,10.1145/3306500.3306528,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366021'}]",,,48-51,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064520768,,,cp,Conference Paper

,Clustering | Expectation maximization algorithm | Firefly movement | K-means algorithm | Light intensity,0,Masangcap M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. K-Means and EM algorithms are the most well-known clustering algorithms because they are simple, easy to understand and implement. However, both algorithms are sensitive to initial seeds which are randomly selected leading to slow convergence and less reliable clustering results. In this paper, an improved initialization method adopted the concept of light intensity and firefly movement to search for better initial seeds. Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Enhanced K-Means and EM using faculty performance evaluation ratings as the dataset. The experiments showed that the implementation of the improved initialization method before the clustering process resulted in a higher intra-cluster and lower inter-cluster similarity. Also, there are fifty-nine percent (59%) and sixty-three percent (63%) decrease in the runtime execution while there are forty-four percent (44%) and twenty-seven percent (27%) fewer number of iterations recorded in the implementation of the enhanced KMeans and EM algorithms respectively.",SCOPUS_ID:85063596339,An improved initialization method using firefly movement and light intensity for better clustering performance,2-s2.0-85063596339,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-10,10.1145/3305160.3305200,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366427'}]",,,30-34,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063596339,,,cp,Conference Paper
,Anti-monotone support pruning | Fp-growth | Frequent pattern | Interestingness | Minimum support,0,Caroro R.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Pattern discovery plays a very important role in mining interesting frequent patterns from any data sources. Besides, it also includes determining whether the pattern is interesting. The study applied the modified anti-monotone support constraint to the Frequent Pattern-Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm to enhance its frequent pattern generation. Besides, the study applied the alteration after constructing the FP tree, thereby traversing and searching the nodes of the tree for possible nodes not satisfying the minimum support. The mining process resulted to a comparable difference in the number of generated itemsets and association rules. The second pruning showed more interesting frequent patterns compared to those generated only from the first pruning. The study used the confidence measure in assessing the algorithm's performance. The result of the evaluation showed that of the two itemsets used in the testing, only very few frequent patterns generated after the first pruning obtained most interesting measures, having 1 out of 6 for itemset S40 and 5 out of 20 for itemset S82.

,Game-based student response system | K-12 | Kahoot | Perception | Performance | Revision tool,0,Catindig J.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. This paper focused on the effectiveness of Kahoot, a game-based student response system, as a revision tool in studying waves. There were sixty-six G12 student participants from an all-boys school in Metro Manila Philippines. The students were all enrolled in SY 2016-2017 and came from different K-12 strands: Science Technology, engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Business, Administration and Management (BAM) and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS). The students were grouped into two, one section (group A) used Kahoot during their revision in waves while the other group (group B) used the common way of revision in which teacher projects the items on the screen and wait for the students to answer each question. Both group of students had the same number of sessions and number of formative assessments in waves. Results showed that there is a significant difference in students' performance in terms of their summative test grades. Group A, who used Kahoot got a significantly higher summative test grades than Group B. In terms of students' perception with the use of Kahoot as a revision tool in studying waves, results showed that most students: 1) had fun during the game; 2) agree that they learned something from the game; 3) said that they will recommend the game; and 4) felt positive after the game. Results also revealed that the performance of the students in the summative test is largely associated with their perception of learning and feeling.",SCOPUS_ID:85064495240,Effectiveness of kahoot as a revision tool in studying waves,2-s2.0-85064495240,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-10,10.1145/3306500.3306550,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366021'}]",,,119-123,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064495240,,,cp,Conference Paper
,21  century e-learning st | Augmented reality | Chemistry education | K12 science | Science education,0,Virata R.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Technology in education has evolved over the decades and has provided more opportunities for technologies such as Augmented Reality to find its way into the pedagogy of teachers in science. In this paper, an AR app was used in facilitating a lesson on chemical bonding and simple compounds. The effects of such innovation were studied using observation and various data gathering methods in an action research design. Results show that AR is a tool that enhances visualization of concepts through elements of virtual and real images, allows students to map physical characteristics easily and aids them in developing mental images for further discourse. Results also show that AR does not only improve motivation but triggers more student-student interaction and teacher-student interaction as well. Students learning attitudes towards chemistry improved in terms of their appreciation of the subject, their perception of its relation to real life and of their meaning-making processes. The teacher indicated that AR apps can innovate the classroom and can provide opportunities for implementation as they are easy to use. However, findings also show that teachers may have a hard time looking for free resources of apps that will meet their needs, and that there is challenge in ensuring that misconceptions are avoided from AR apps' oversimplification of visualization.

,Achievement | Gamification | Motivation | Physics,0,Tolentino A.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Gamification is the use of game elements and game-design techniques in non-game contexts. It has five main elements: points, badges, leaderboards, rules and levels. A classroom that has any or all of these elements can be considered a gamified classroom. This study explored the effects of a gamified environment to the motivation and achievement of high school students in Physics. The framework of the study is anchored on the Self-Determination Theory which claims that humans are inherently active, inquisitive and self-motivated even without external reward. However, extrinsic motivators can be converted to intrinsic motivators if they are meaningful, pleasurable and consistent with a person's worldview. To determine if gamification has a significant effect on the student motivation, the students' responses to the pre-gamification and post-gamification administration of the Physics Motivation Questionnaire were compared using the paired sample t-test on SPSS. Its effects to student achievement in Physics, on the other hand, was identified after calculating the mean normalized gains for all the pretests-posttests administration after each of the 5 modules. Feedback from students, teacher-implementer and external observers were collected and analyzed. Results showed that gamified instruction brings about a significant increase in student achievement in Physics but not in student motivation. However, the feedback coming from students, teacher-implementer and external observers substantiate the influence of gamification to student motivation. Implementation must be done properly so that no unhealthy competition develops, no student becomes extremely grade conscious that he or she ends up resorting to cheating and that an environment conducive to learning is maintained inside the classroom. Consequently, it is recommended that more rigorous studies should be done to further confirm or invalidate the effects of gamification in learning Physics that are exposed in this study.",SCOPUS_ID:85064474787,Gamified physics instruction in a reformatory classroom context,2-s2.0-85064474787,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-10,10.1145/3306500.3306527,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366021'}]",,,135-140,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064474787,,,cp,Conference Paper

According to the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Metro Manila produces about 25% of the country's solid waste, 16% of which are plastics. Unfortunately, recycling is limited to only ∼20% of these plastic wastes; the rest goes to landfills. To address this problem, the Humanitarian Engineering, Entrepreneurship, and Design (HEED) group of the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) started Project Plastikan-a plastics recycling project that aims to provide income opportunities for women in marginalized communities by building a plastics recycling facility based on the design of David Hakkens, founder of Precious Plastics. The facility will house various recycling machines with open-source designs to be built by UP students in partnership with the UP FABLAB. The pilot community is in Malabon, Metro Manila-one of the field sites of the UP College of Social Work and Community Development (CSWCD). The project involves three phases: (1) needs assessment and market research, (2) fabrication of appropriate machines, and (3) technology transfer and training. Through this project, the women in the community will be manufacturing upcycled products themselves.

The Philippines is a disaster-prone country which is visited by an average of 20 typhoons per year. Located along the Pacific ring of fire, natural calamities such as earthquakes and volcano eruptions also occur in the country. In times of calamity, cellular service could go down which makes the coordination with local government units and emergency response teams difficult. Moreover, majority of the population is heavily dependent on cellular phones making rescue operations more challenging when cellular systems go down. A need for a robust and reliable communication system arises during times of calamity in the country and amateur radio is an option. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and portable implementation of an amateur radio module based on Raspberry Pi (RPi) that can convert a message from a smartphone sent through Wi-Fi to an Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) broadcast that can be recognized by amateur radio equipment.

In the Philippines, efforts are being made to address inaccessibility of Internet access by 42% of the population. One such service installs Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas and government buildings. To make the service more effective, data on Wi-Fi access point deployment is vital. While there exist platforms for crowdsourced data submission such as WiGLE, and methods such as dedicated wardriving, these can be costly, infrequent, and can easily become outdated. Regular data collection on Wi-Fi access points is necessary for better accuracy. For regular, inexpensive, and frequent data gathering, opportunistic wardriving is proposed, in which neighborhood public utility vehicles, such as the tricycle, are utilized to serve as vehicles for gathering network data. Leveraging public utility vehicles is inexpensive, and ensures regularity of data gathering because of their usual trips. Comparing this method with crowdsourced data, it is found that opportunistic wardriving is able to find at least 60% of the access points in an area. Opportunistic wardriving also ensures wide coverage of an area, accessing 83% of the chosen location, Brgy. Teachers Village East, in forty trips.

,Internationalization | MST-based clustering | Prim's MST | Small World Network | Von Neumann Neighborhood,1,Lingaya S.,"© 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications. Graph-theoretic clustering either uses limited neighborhood or construction of a minimum spanning tree to aid the clustering process. The latter is challenged by the need to identify and consequently eliminate inconsistent edges to achieve final clusters, detect outliers and partition substantially. This work focused on mining the data of the International Linkages of Philippine Higher Education Institutions by employing a modified graph-theoretic clustering algorithm with which the Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm was used to construct a minimum spanning tree for the internationalization dataset infusing the properties of a small world network. Such properties are invoked by the computation of local clustering coefficient for the data elements in the limited neighborhood of data points established using the von Neumann Neighborhood. The overall result of the cluster validation using the Silhouette Index with a score of .69 indicates that there is an acceptable structure found in the clustering result - hence, a potential of the modified MST-based clustering algorithm. The Silhouette per cluster with .75 being the least score means that each cluster derived for r=5 by the von Neumann Neighborhood has a strong clustering structure.",SCOPUS_ID:85070530508,Modified graph-theoretic clustering algorithm for mining international linkages of philippine higher education institutions,2-s2.0-85070530508,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,2158107X,6,90-95,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070530508,10,,ar,Article

The measurements were carried out using two Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers which are coupled to a digital multimeter. Several measurements were made at different positions and immersion lengths that covered the entire working space of the calibration bath. Results of measurements showed that the stability of calibration bath at each temperature setting are more stable at lower temperatures and tends to increase as the temperature reaches 200ºC. The temperature of the liquid calibration bath is more uniform at lower temperature setting as well. The temperature differences obtained were not significantly scattered since the curve-fitted equation describing the behavior of stability and uniformity do not deviate significantly from the actual measured values. This indicates that other calibration laboratories can also perform stability and uniformity tests unique to their set-up at an accuracy level consistent with industrial accuracy requirement.,SCOPUS_ID:85070002656,Characterization of silicon oil calibration bath through stability and uniformity tests using standard platinum resistance thermometer and precision multimeter,2-s2.0-85070002656,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,09743154,5,705-710,International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070002656,12,,ar,Article

Using the descriptive and developmental design, the study developed and evaluated an Irrigated Rice Yield projeCtion E-application (iRYCE) to predict rice yield of irrigated farms in Bayombong, Solano, Bagabag and Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. A total of twenty (20) farmer participants with irrigated rice fields adjacent to each other were the respondents from the four municipalities. While forty (40) system evaluators and end users from the academe, DA planning officer, ICT program developer and agriculturist/technician evaluated the proposed iRYCE application. A questionnaire, interviews and observations were conducted from the field practices of the farmers with all the inputs in the conceptual paradigm of this study. The researcher used frequency count and percentage distribution, mean, chi-square, pearson r and linear regression analysis to predict and determine the extent of relationship of projected rice yield with the result of soil analysis, average yield of the participants per annum, rice variety, fertilizer application, number of days of rice seedling before transplanting and harvesting. Dynamic System Development Method Framework was utilized as its guide in the development of the iRYCE application. As a result, Nitrogen nutrient of the soil samples from the four municipalities had a low qualitative description. Phosphorous nutrient test had a qualitative description distributed from low to high and Potassium had a high qualitative description. The municipality of Solano had an average description rating in terms of average yield per annum while the three other municipalities had a descriptive rating of low. The overall rice varieties that were utilized by the farmer participants were RC 222 (45%), RC 226 (25%), RC 216 (12.5%), RC 152 (10%), RC 440 (5%) and RC138 (2.5%). Majority of the farmer participants followed fifteen days (15) after transplanting in their fertilizer application of side dress. While the days before harvesting practice of the farmer participants had a range from 108 to 115 days.

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is the most widely used symmetric-key algorithm for encryption algorithm. Different attacks like brute force and cryptanalysis attack can be used to break DES due to its small key size and simple and uniform distribution XOR operation. With the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes modification to enhance DES against these various attacks. The proposed enhancement used f-function by incorporating striding techniques instead of just performing the XOR operation between 56- bit sub key and the plaintext. The security against the known exhaustive attack and cryptanalysis attack was enhanced. The enhanced DES have been evaluated and compared against original DES using avalanche effect. Enhanced DES resulted to an average of avalanche effect of 55% due to one-bit vibration in plaintext.",SCOPUS_ID:85066959266,Enhanced Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm based on filtering and striding techniques,2-s2.0-85066959266,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1145/3322645.3322671,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450361033'}]",,,252-256,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066959266,Part F148384,,cp,Conference Paper

Generally, the concentration of the study and research in the understanding of sounds revolves around the speech and music area, on the contrary, there are few in environmental and non-speech recognition. This paper carries out a meta-analysis of the acoustic transformation and feature set extraction of the environmental sound raw signal form into a parametric type representation in handling analysis, perception, and labeling for audio analysis of sound identification systems. We evaluated and analyzed the various contemporary methods and feature algorithms surveyed for the acoustic identification and perception of surrounding sounds, the Gammatone spectral coefficients (GSTC) and Mel Filterbank (FBEs) then the acoustic signal classification the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) was applied. The outcome demonstrates that GSTC accomplished better as a feature in contrast to FBEs, but FBEs tend to improve performance when merge or incorporated with other feature.

Median filtering is a nonlinear kind of image filtering which is effectively used in reducing the image noise while maintaining the edges of the image. One advantage of median filtering is eliminating the effect of input noise values with very large magnitudes. Median Filter decreases noise from an image without edge destruction and blurring but the performance will be degraded in a high density of noise. This paper presents an improved median filtering algorithm. The process was modified by identifying the noise density of the image and the window size of the image will be the basis to be used in sorting the pixel. Furthermore, the median value will replace the pixel value in the entire window. The result shows that the modified median filtering has a detailed and clearer output.",SCOPUS_ID:85065772825,A modified median filtering algorithm (MMFA),2-s2.0-85065772825,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,,,20780958,,377-380,Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065772825,2239,,cp,Conference Paper
,Image analysis | Segmentation | Statistical distribution | Thresholding,1,Unajan M.,"© 2019 Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved. Image thresholding is usually a preprocessing step in a number of image processing algorithms. The segmented images are input for image analyses, computer vision, and visualizations and object representation. Otsu thresholding method is a widely used image thresholding technique. It provides fairly accurate results for segmenting a gray level image with only one modal distribution in a gray level histogram. However, one of the drawbacks is high computational cost and noise that are mostly contributed by inappropriate expression of class statistical distributions. This paper presents an improved Otsu-based image segmentation algorithm to enhance the performance of the Otsu method. Standard deviation is used in the computation of the optimal threshold instead of using variance. A reasonable threshold range is computed to lower the computational cost. Testing results showed that the improved method is more satisfactory than the original Otsu thresholding algorithm.",SCOPUS_ID:85065770211,A modified otsu-based image segmentation algorithm (OBISA),2-s2.0-85065770211,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,,,20780958,,363-366,Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065770211,2239,,cp,Conference Paper

Agriculture is the world's major industry with 60% of the global population depending on it. Being the major source of livelihood, agriculture is challenged by issues such as food shortage, food security problems, climate change affecting crop yield, land degradation, decrease of crop varieties and others. There is a huge amount of knowledge products generated by the government agencies, local universities, private civic groups, local government units and non-government organizations (NGOs) to address these issues however the information has difficulty reaching the intended farm practitioners as end-user. With this aforesaid challenge, a technology based information sharing and access among stakeholders such as agricultural knowledge experts (academe) and knowledge end-users (farmers) is a dire need. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has always been an indispensable tool that can provide an environment where knowledge generators and knowledge users can use to exchange information any time and place. Retooling and scaling up the process how information and knowledge products is being accessed and shared is indeed a critical consideration. Using descriptive research and qualitative approach, this study determined an ICT tool, a managed SMS-based system to be highly acceptable to the identified stakeholders as an information sharing medium and model and is therefore recommended for use.

,Convolutional neural network | Image processing techniques | Leaf detection | Tobacco grading,0,Marzan C.,"© 2019 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology. Tobacco grading is very important for crop market price determination. It is beneficial for graders who need to manually classify tobacco leaves according to their grades. As such, a grading system using image processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed in this study which aims to surpass existing results in tobacco grading. The system consists of image acquisition, pre-processing, leaf detection, segmentation, and classification. Tobacco leaf images were directly taken at the tobacco grading room and pre-processed for subsequent tasks. Through a Haar cascade classifier and applying image processing techniques, air-cured tobacco leaves are automatically detected and extracted in images. This method produced satisfactory results as it can successfully detect single and multiple tobacco leaves taken under different positions and scale. All detected tobacco leaves underwent various image processing to precisely segment leaves from the rest of the image. The experimental results also reveal that using segmented and nonsegmented images, CNN classifier can effectively grade tobacco leaves as high as 96.25% accuracy rate and on average, took 7.43 ms to classify a single tobacco leaf. This approach outperforms current methods in grading tobacco leaves.",SCOPUS_ID:85077556261,Automated tobacco grading using image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network,2-s2.0-85077556261,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.18178/ijmlc.2019.9.6.877,,,6,807-813,International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077556261,9,,ar,Article

Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is a technology-driven inquiry-based approach that encourages social interaction and shared knowledge construction in completing computer-aided tasks. Although there were researches carried out on CSCL, no research to date has extensively examined how CSCL enhanced with scripts containing student-generated questions can facilitate the development of logical thinking, an essential skill to effectively comprehend science concepts. In this light, this research examined the effects of co-creating scripts in CSCL on students’ logical thinking. This utilized a three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design with two delayed posttests which involved Grade 7 students. One group was exposed to CSCL with scripting while the other group was exposed to CSCL without scripting. On the other hand, the control group was exposed to a conventional teaching approach. Findings revealed that CSCL approaches significantly improved students’ logical thinking, F(2, 113) = 5.616, p =.0025. Further, the delayed posttests consistently showed that CSCL with scripting significantly influenced the development of logical thinking. Notably, this research builds and extends on previous researches regarding the synergistic scaffolding of the inquiry-based approach, technology integration, collaborative learning, and question-asking activity.

The Poset Cover Problem is an optimization problem where the goal is to determine a minimum set of posets that covers a given set of linear orders. This problem is relevant in the field of data mining, specifically in determining directed networks or models that explain the ordering of objects in a large sequential dataset. It is already known that the decision version of the problem is NP-Hard while its variation where the goal is to determine only a single poset that covers the input is in P. In this study, we investigate the variation, which we call the 2-Poset Cover Problem, where the goal is to determine two posets, if they exist, that cover the given linear orders. We derive properties on posets, which leads to an exact solution for the 2-Poset Cover Problem. Although the algorithm runs in exponential-time, it is still significantly faster than a brute-force solution. Moreover, we show that when the posets being considered are tree-posets, the running-time of the algorithm becomes polynomial, which proves that the more restricted variation, which we called the 2-Tree-Poset Cover Problem, is also in P.",SCOPUS_ID:85074339604,On finding two posets that cover given linear orders,2-s2.0-85074339604,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology for Social Development,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.3390/a12100219,,,10,,Algorithms,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074339604,12,,ar,Article

The effectiveness of cocopeat as an adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals was reported in previous studies. In this study, cocopeat was used as an adsorbent in a filter bed system treating wastewater from a small scale gold mining (SSGM) ball mill facility. A total of 6,000 L of actual SSGM wastewater collected from a ball mill facility in Paracale, Camarines Norte were used in the experimental runs. The filter bed was evaluated by determining its heavy metal removal efficiencies for 50 days at a flow rate of 40 L/hr. After the experimental runs, HYDRUS-1D was used to simulate the transport of lead (Pb) in the filter bed and predict the remaining useful life of cocopeat as a heavy metal adsorbent. Lead was selected for the solute transport modeling in HYDRUS-1D since Pb was the highest concentration in the wastewater and also exceeded the government effluent limit. Measured data from the experimental runs and water flow parameters of cocopeat were used as input values in the simulation with varying cocopeat thickness and initial concentration flux. Results showed that by increasing the thickness of the cocopeat layer, the useful life of cocopeat in the filter bed was extended. By using the actual concentration of Pb (0.0933 mg/L) in the wastewater, HYDRUS-1D was able to simulate Pb transport in the filter and predict that the useful life of cocopeat 50 cm thick treating an actual SSGM wastewater was 2.74 years.",SCOPUS_ID:85073505175,Predicting useful life of cocopeat in a filter bed treating wastewater with heavy metals using HYDRUS-1D,2-s2.0-85073505175,,undefined,Department of Science and Technology for Social Development,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,,2,44-56,ASEAN Engineering Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073505175,9,,ar,Article

Hormonal imbalance is often pointed out by medical experts to be the cause of menstrual irregularity, a common problem of women. This study aims to develop a device that would determine if a patient has hormonal imbalance by testing saliva's conductivity onto the device for 28 consecutive days, thus, determining the cause of the patient's menstrual irregularity. To test the accuracy of the device, the researchers selected three women residing in one home to use the device. To determine if a woman has hormonal imbalance, the data, when plotted in a chart, should have a sudden peak. However, data can't be analyzed through visual assumptions only. Therefore, the data is analyzed through sample standard deviation. If one data is higher or lower than the sum and difference of the sample standard deviation and the mean, the woman is negative in hormonal imbalance.

Water is imperative in the regular day to day existence of the human race. Household people use water to sustain life. Nowadays, household people excessively use water without knowing how much water do they already consume in real-time and are unaware on which faucet in the household has the highest water consumption. With the use of the internet of things (IoT) platform with visual analytics (VA), a real-time water consumption monitoring system has been developed for household and commercialized building applications. In order to get the water consumption data, a Hall Effect water flow sensor is attached to every faucet, which is then processed by a NodeMCU, then pushed to the Heroku cloud database. A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) alphanumeric screen displays the total volume consumed and the real-time water flow rate for each faucet. To further visualize the water consumption data, a comprehensible chart report about the overall household water consumption from the cloud database can be accessed through a web browser or a mobile device. To achieve an accurate water flow measurement, an initial calibration is being performed for every sensor in the faucet. A test was conducted to determine how accurate the system is in monitoring the correct water consumption. Ten trials of filling up a 10-liter bottle using one faucet, two 10-liter bottles using two faucets, and three 10-liter bottles using three faucets at a time was conducted.

All rights reserved. A species-specific spatially explicit individual-based model has been developed to simulate the development of mixed mangrove forest stands featuring eight species. The model is a forest stand model that forecasts mangrove forest development in a 50 m x 50 m plot by simulating the recruitment, growth, and mortality of individual mangrove trees. Species-specific growth rates, shade responses, and salinity responses of each species were incorporated to observe differences in forest structure given different salinity conditions. The model used a modified Field of Neighborhood (FON) approach that considers species-specific responses to shading and a salinity response function that considers the species-specific salinity upper boundary value of optimum growth and maximum porewater salinity of a mangrove. Simulation results of 300 years given salinity conditions in a specific site in Katunggan It Ibajay (KII) showed matching dominant species in the site. Simulation results of 500 years given extreme low and high salinity values showed consistent forest dynamics where above-ground biomass and tree count approach certain limit values as the forest stand matures.

,Banana harvest yield forecasting | Deep Learning | Long short-term memory | Yield forecasting,0,Rebortera M.,"© 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited. This technical quest aspired to build deep multifaceted system proficient in forecasting banana harvest yields essential for extensive planning for a sustainable production in the agriculture sector. Recently, deep-learning (DL) approach has been used as a new alternative model in forecasting. In this paper, the enhanced DL approach incorporates multiple long short term memory (LSTM) layers employed with multiple neurons in each layer, fully trained and built a state for forecasting. The enhanced model used the banana harvest yield data from agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) cooperative of Dapco in Davao del Norte, Philippines. The model parameters such as epoch, batch size and neurons underwent tuning to identify its optimal values to be used in the experiments. Additionally, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Using the same set of training and testing data, experiment exhibits that the enhanced model achieved the optimal result of 34.805 in terms of RMSE. This means that the enhanced model outperforms the single and multiple LSTM layer with 43.5 percent and 44.95 percent reduction in error rates, respectively. Since there is no proof that LSTM recurrent neutral network has been used with the same agricultural problem domain, therefore, there is no standard available with regards to the level of error reduction in the forecast. Moreover, investigating the performance of the model using diverse datasets specifically with multiple input features (multivariate) is suggested for exploration. Furthermore, extending and embedding this approach to a web-based along with a handy application is the future plan for the benefit of the medium scale banana growers of the region for efficient and effective decision making and advance planning.",SCOPUS_ID:85072971081,An enhanced deep learning approach in forecasting banana harvest yields,2-s2.0-85072971081,ARB,undefined,"Arts Research Board, McMaster University",0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,2158107X,9,275-280,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072971081,10,,ar,Article

,Augmented reality | Educational game design | Game-based learning | Learning motivation | Location-based apps | Usability,0,Vidal E.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Location-based AR (LBAR) games offer a potentially viable learning platform for history-related content, but the experience is impaired by player fatigue due to compulsory movement between real-world locations, causing engagement to drop as the length of the game increases. This paper proposes incorporating card-collection mechanics (virtual collectibles/achievements in contemporary games) into an existing history-related, narrative-based LBAR game, Igpaw: Loyola, to counter the effect of fatigue to player engagement while increasing their capacity to absorb educational content. Participants, divided into control and experimental batches, were tasked to play Igpaw: Loyola without and with the collection mechanic, respectively, under logged observation. Both versions of the game included required and optional locations. The control and experimental batches reported only minor differences in application usability, but a majority of the experimental batch visited the optional locations as opposed to none from the control batch. In the post-quiz, the experimental batch scored the same or better (on average and on each individual question) than the control batch. This leads to the conclusion that the card-collection mechanic significantly and positively impacts both the engagement and learning retention of players, and it is recommended for future LBAR games.",SCOPUS_ID:85069692728,Card-Collection Mechanics in Educational Location-Based AR Games: Transforming Learning Goals to Virtual Rewards,2-s2.0-85069692728,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-23528-4_10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783030235277'}]",18650929,,69-75,Communications in Computer and Information Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069692728,1033,,cp,Conference Paper
,Clustering | Fuzzy C-Means | High dimensional dataset | Manhattan distance,0,Tolentino J.,"© 2019 International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology. The problem of mining a high dimensional data includes a high computational cost, a high dimensional dataset composed of thousands of attribute and or instances. The efficiency of an algorithm, specifically, its speed is oftentimes sacrificed when this kind of dataset is supplied to the algorithm. Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is one which suffers from this problem. This clustering algorithm requires high computational resources as it processes whether low or high dimensional data. Netflix data rating, small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs) and Colon Cancer (52,308, and 2,000 of attributes and 1500, 83 and 62 of instances respectively) dataset were identified as a high dimensional dataset. As such, the Manhattan distance measure employing the trigonometric function was used to enhance the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Results show an increase on the efficiency of processing large amount of data using the Netflix, Colon cancer and SRCBT an (39,296, 38,952 and 85,774 milliseconds to complete the different clusters, respectively) average of 54,674 milliseconds while Manhattan distance measure took an average of (36,858, 36,501 and 82,86 milliseconds, respectively) 52,703 milliseconds for the entire dataset to cluster. On the other hand, the enhanced Manhattan distance measure took (33,216, 32,368 and 81,125 milliseconds, respectively) 48,903 seconds on clustering the datasets. Given the said result, the enhanced Manhattan distance measure is 11% more efficient compared to Euclidean distance measure and 7% more efficient than the Manhattan distance measure respectively.",SCOPUS_ID:85068397094,Enhanced Manhattan-based clustering using fuzzy C-means algorithm for high dimensional datasets,2-s2.0-85068397094,City,undefined,"City, University of London",1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.18517/ijaseit.9.3.6005,,20885334,3,766-771,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068397094,9,,ar,Article

Interest in blue carbon has drastically increased in recent years, particularly in improving the coastal resource carbon storage estimates and the development of methodology for identifying and monitoring such resources. In coastal resource mapping, participatory mapping techniques have the potential to provide a level of granularity and detail by taking advantage of local knowledge. In this work, we aim to evaluate the agreement between blue carbon ecosystem status obtained from participatory mapping versus the ones discriminated from satellite images, as well as assess how “relative proximity” to landmarks affects the accuracy. Results showed that the accuracy of mapped mangrove extents, evaluated as intersection-over-union, is positively correlated with frequency of visits. It is also found that maps generated by participants who have jobs or activities that nurture awareness about mangroves and seagrasses tend to agree better with remotely-sensed maps. The participants were even able to identify small patches of mangroves and seagrasses that are not present in the classified satellite images. While our initial work explores factors that impact the consistency between these sources, there is a need to establish a baseline for which both sources of information are evaluated against; and define relevant accuracy metrics. Our final goal is to systematically combine these two sources of information for an accurate holistic coastal resource map.",SCOPUS_ID:85066806242,"Mapping of blue carbon ecosystems: Effect of proximity, activity types and frequency of visits in the accuracy of participatory maps",2-s2.0-85066806242,,04038,"Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development",1,True,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W12-83-2019,,16821750,4/W12,83-88,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066806242,42,,cp,Conference Paper

CC BY 4.0 License This research presents a method in assessing the impact of Ground Control Point (GCP) distribution, quantity, and inter-GCP distances on the output Digital Elevation Model (DEM) by utilizing SfM and GIS. The study was carried out in a quarry site to assess the impacts of these parameters on the accuracy of accurate volumetric measurements UAV derivatives. Based on GCP Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and surface checkpoint error (SCE), results showed that the best configuration is the evenly distributed GCP set (1.58 m average RMSE, 1.30 m average SCE). Configurations clumped to edge and distributed to edge follow suit with respective RMSE (SCE) of 2.53 m (2.13 m) and 3.11 m (2.54 m). The clumped to center configuration yielded 6.23 m RMSE and 4.66 m SCE. As the number of GCPs used increase, the RMSE and SCE are observed to decrease consistently for all configurations. Further iteration of the best configuration showed that from RMSE of 4.11 m when 4 GCPs are used, there is a drastic decrease to 0.86 m once 10 GCPs are used. From that quantity, only centimeter differences can be observed until the full set of 24 GCPs have been used with a 0.012 m error. This is reflected in the stockpile measurement when the iteration results are compared to the reference data. The dataset processed with a minimum of 4 GCPs have a 606,991.43 m3 difference, whereas the dataset processed with 23 out of 24 has a 791.12 m3 difference from the reference data.

Hashing is a procedure that can be used for a program to gain access to data quickly. It is very popular in many IT areas such as route lookup, cryptography development, and string data indexing for fast searching among others. Open Addressing and Separate Chaining are the generally two known collision resolutions if a hash function fails to plot a unique index. Engaging any collision resolution will result in multiple key comparisons and memory accesses causing time to increase linearly thus the lookup latency becomes indeterminate, posing an unpredictable outcome to some time-critical systems. Although the collision problem is inevitable, the proposed hashing algorithm using 2D vector and hash functions on its collision resolution can achieve lookup time at one or two memory accesses while resolving the collision.",SCOPUS_ID:85066151403,Enhanced hash algorithm using a two-dimensional vector to improve data search performance,2-s2.0-85066151403,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-6031-2_32,,23673370,,59-69,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066151403,67,,ch,Chapter

,Coffee farming | Data mining | Elbow plot | K-means clustering | Smartphone manipulation skills,0,Pagudpud M.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. The Philippines is largely an agricultural country, and the importance of coffee in the Philippines cannot be undervalued. However, the coffee plantations are generally confronted with various insect pests and diseases. This is the reason why authorities continue to look for solutions through technological applications for coffee farming. Smartphones are becoming a functional tool in agriculture because its mobility served as an advantage to agriculture. However, challenges regarding the level of ICT, particularly of smartphones technology usage among the rural community is low due to limited knowledge and skills. Thus, this study has the primary objective to apply data mining to the smartphone manipulation skills of possible users’ dataset in the province of Quirino, Philippines. Specifically, it sought to determine the optimal number of the types of potential users and to identify the different types of possible users and their skills that emerged from the clustering. The result shows that k=4 is the best choice for the dataset. The four clusters formed to represent the four groups of possible users are the good users with 25 instances, skilled users with 35 instances, the users with limited skills with 83 instances and finally, the expert users with 32 instances.

,Autoencoders in autoencoder | Semantic image segmentation | Stacked autoencoders,0,Yusiong J.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Semantic image segmentation is essential for scene understanding. Several state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches achieved remarkable results by increasing the network depth to improve performance. Using this principle, we introduce a novel encoder-decoder network architecture for semantic image segmentation of outdoor scenes called SAsiANet. SAsiANet utilizes multi-scale cascaded autoencoders at the decoder section of an autoencoder to achieve high accuracy pixel-wise prediction and involves exploiting features across multiple scales when upsampling the output of the encoder to obtain better spatial and contextual information effectively. The proposed network architecture is trained using the cross-entropy loss function but without incorporating any class balancing technique to the loss function. Our experimental results on two challenging outdoor scenes: the CamVid urban scenes dataset and the Freiburg forest dataset demonstrate that SAsiANet provides an effective way of producing accurate segmentation maps since it achieved state-of-the-art results on the test set of both datasets, &#x0024;&#x0024;72.40\%&#x0024;&#x0024; mIoU, and &#x0024;&#x0024;89.90\%&#x0024;&#x0024; mIoU, respectively.",SCOPUS_ID:85064560133,Multi-scale Autoencoders in Autoencoder for Semantic Image Segmentation,2-s2.0-85064560133,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-14799-0_51,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783030147983'}]",03029743,,587-599,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064560133,11431 LNAI,,cp,Conference Paper

The use of image processing and classification for agricultural applications has been widely studied and has led to work such as the automatic grading of fruit and vegetables, yield approximation and defect detection. Image segmentation is one of the first steps to identify the region of interest within an image. This paper presents an approach to automatic segmentation and classification of healthy and defective Carabao mangoes. K-means, range filtering and color-channel segmentation were utilized so that the varying texture and color of mangoes due to the surface defects can be considered. Results show that the proposed technique performs better than the classical K-means segmentation. The performance of segmentation step has a considerable influence on the precision of the classification model. Segmented and not segmented images were trained using KNN, SVM, MLP and CNN.

Evacuation planning is one of the fundamental instruments to mitigate negative impacts of this hazard to the community. Routing is part of evacuation planning that determines the best routes for relocating population. In this study, evacuation routing is focused to the output of the UP Mindanao Phil-LiDAR1. The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is an airborne mapping method that delivers geospatial data in the form of point clouds with high-accuracy elevation values and ground features. Building and road network features extracted from the LiDAR data were used to create network dataset. Flood hazard models were used to identify areas in the network that are at risk of flooding. Capacity Aware Shortest Path Evacuation Routing (CASPER) of the ArcGIS Network Analyst Tool’s extension was used to simulate evacuation routes. The tool uses the CASPER algorithm, a heuristic evacuation routing method that takes into account the capacity of the transportation network and the traffic flow in order to minimize traffic congestion.

,Classification | Deep learning | ECG | Heart disease | Inception v3 | Physionet | Spectrogram,4,Panganiban E.,"© 2019 World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved. Deep learning is among the most reliable approaches in analyzing physiological signals for healthcare applications. This makes data mining strategies more useful and reliable in analyzing a large group of data like medical records. Through this technology breakthrough, the authors established a novel approach in examining electrocardiogram (ECG) records and classify them on what kind of heart disease based from its pattern using spectrogram image analysis. These records underwent data training as part of the deep learning process. Data trained are in the form of extracted ECG logs in comma-separated values (CSV) format from different patient cases. These databases are downloaded from Physionet databases, which offers free access to an extensive collection of recorded physiological data. Once done downloading, these databases were categorized per disease type. Records of diseases that were in the same category must be saved in the same folder. These CSV files passed through a preprocessing procedure through filtering CSV log files and cut each ECG reading into 10-second duration and save it as text file. These text files were converted into their spectrogram images equivalent. The converted text files to spectrogram images were still categorized per disease type. The file name of each folder containing the spectrogram images for each disease type served as the label map for the output classifier. The final layer was retrained for dataset development through the use of Google's Inception V3 model that serves as a base learning model. Fine tuning was established through setting its training rate to 0.001, training batch size to 500, a validation batch size of 200 and a total number of training steps of 500,000. These settings had achieved the optimum result of 100% validation and training accuracy each. The result of final test accuracy is 98.9% and had generated a frozen model for the classifier. Its accuracy can improve if there are more available and reliable ECG records. Using the frozen model, the same procedures were done in preparing the dataset to be used for the testing stage. The result of the classification of disease is shown through the percentage value of how likely is the input spectrogram image based from disease categories.

,Convolutional neural networks | Data augmentation | Object detection | Transfer learning | X-ray image,0,Galvez R.,"© Insight Society. Object detection in X-ray images is an interesting problem in the field of machine vision. The reason is that images from an X-ray machine are usually obstructed with other objects and to itself, therefore object classification and localization is a challenging task. Furthermore, obtaining X-ray data is difficult due to an insufficient dataset available compared with photographic images from a digital camera. It is vital to easily detect objects in an X-ray image because it can be used as decision support in the detection of threat items such as improvised explosive devices (IED's) in airports, train stations, and public places. Detection of IED components accurately requires an expert and can be achieved through extensive training. Also, manual inspection is tedious, and the probability of missed detection increases due to several pieces of baggage are scanned in a short period of time. As a solution, this paper used different object detection techniques (Faster R-CNN, SSD, R-FCN) and feature extractors (ResNet, MobileNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet) based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in a novel IEDXray dataset in the detection of IED components. The IEDXray dataset is an X-ray image of IED replicas without the explosive material. Transfer learning with data augmentation was performed due to limited X-ray data available to train the whole network from scratch. Evaluation results showed that individual detection achieved 99.08% average precision (AP) in mortar detection and 77.29% mAP in three IED components.",SCOPUS_ID:85078008293,Object detection in x-ray images using transfer learning with data augmentation,2-s2.0-85078008293,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.18517/ijaseit.9.6.9960,,20885334,6,2147-2153,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078008293,9,,ar,Article
,Computer vision | Convolutional neural network | Mango | Sorting,0,Cases C.,"© 2019 Insight Society. Philippines is one of the world's leading exporter of mangoes. The country produces many varieties of mangoes, one of which is the 'Carabao' mango. Several metric tons of mangoes are produced, and these have to be checked for defects before entering the market. With recent advances in technology, it has become efficient and relatively easy to use for these applications. The objective of this paper is to present a non-destructive method to check the quality of mangoes using computer vision (CV) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with a minimal number of samples. An experimental setup was created to simulate a production line. A webcam was used for capturing images of the mangoes, while a mini computer was used for controlling the peripherals. As basis for categorizing the mangoes as either good or bad, the Philippine National Standard (PNS) for mangoes was used. A basic background subtraction algorithm was used to extract the mango's image. With these extracted images, a 2-category network was trained, and the achieved classification accuracy was 97.21%. The goal of having a high accuracy in classifying mangoes was achieved. There are multiple paths to explore in the future, including additional feature extraction methods, different neural networks, and hardware improvements, in order to speed up the sorting process. Moreover, it may be necessary to be able to identify mangoes with only slight defects to be used for other products, such as dried mangoes, to reduce product wastage.",SCOPUS_ID:85077605136,Quality assessment and prediction of philippine mangoes: A convolutional neural network approach,2-s2.0-85077605136,DOST,undefined,"Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines",0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,20885334,6,2128-2133,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077605136,9,,ar,Article

111040B,Liquid lens | PDMS | Variable focus,0,Añonuevo J.,"© 2019 SPIE. Fluidic lenses offer tunability and flexibility that are not available with conventional solid lenses. The development of a variable focus lens has the potential for replacing bulky optical systems and allows the miniaturization of imaging optics used in digital cameras and mobile phone cameras. In this paper, a liquid lens platform for use in an undergraduate laboratory setting is presented. A variable lens is prepared by injecting water into bulk polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that remains uncured in its fluid state. We report the tunable focusing ability of this simple liquid lens system and analyze the change in focal length as a function of injected water volume. The water-PDMS interface acts as a diverging lens, in agreement with ray tracing analysis based on curvature and refractive indices. Variable focal lengths are measured with an optical set-up employing a helium-neon laser and a solid converging lens with focal length = 2.5 cm. By increasing the water volume from 0.05 to 0.30 ml, we are able to tune the focal length from-6.5 mm to-10.6 mm. Lens geometry remains spherical as the curvature of the lens changes with the addition of water. Our experiments coincide with a simple theoretical framework for a thick lens immersed in a medium.

,Bolt tightening | Construction | Parallel processing | Steel structure | Vertical climbing robot,0,Chu T.,"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. A design of a vertical climbing robot is proposed for steel structure application which specializes in bolt tightening. It utilizes 2 main components, the robot positioning and bolt tightening mechanisms. The robot positioning mechanism allows the robot to move vertically along the steel column; while, the bolt tightening mechanism executes the bolt tightening sequence. The robot should be able to climb up steel I-beam columns, detect location of snug-tightened bolts, map the position of each bolt, and tighten the bolts. The research begins with the design for each component and defining its function and validation is done through simulation of the control process in PICOSOFT 6. The mechanical design of the robot compared to the CFs consists less components which allow quick and flexible installation as it can adjust to different column specifications. The simulation is able to show and execute the sequence of tasks executed such as climbing, sensing of bolts, mapping, and bolt tightening. The vertical climbing robot can execute the bolt tightening task similar to CFs, however the robot is integrated with parallel processing allowing it to be autonomous and consume less time to execute bolt tightening tasks. It maps out the bolts through the CHT algorithm together with the CAM shift method to accurately locate the position of the bolt and tighten the bolts successively with minimal human interaction. Since the paper offers a simulation of the process, further studies such as physical experimentation can be applied to further validate the application of the robot in construction.",SCOPUS_ID:85075247421,Design of parallel processing vertical climbing robot for autonomous bolt tightening of steel structure bolts,2-s2.0-85075247421,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,,9,3402-3409,Compusoft,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075247421,8,,ar,Article

All rights reserved. The level of competence of the new nursing personnel of Ospital ng Lungsod ng San Jose Del Monte is an important factor in measuring the quality of care a new nurse can provide. A new nurse, when given proper training, can be competent enough to face the challenges of the profession. This study adapted Patricia Benner’s levels of skill acquisition of nursing personnel: Novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient and expert. The researcher determined the current profile of the new nurses hired in OLSJDM, evaluation of the head nurses and new nurses in terms of the eleven core competencies (11), and the significant difference between the head nurses’ evaluation and new staff nurses’ self-rating on the level of competence of new nurses in OLSJDM. A standard competency-based evaluation tool formulated by the CHED in the CMO was used to determine the level of competency of the new nursing personnel. The Descriptive method was used to summarize the results, and test for the difference of means was used to determine if there is significant difference in the head nurses’ rating and new nurses self-rating in terms of their level of competency. There were two respondent groups; the new nurses who were recently hired and head nurses or superiors of the new nurses. The new nurses rated themselves according to their perception of their own performance and the head nurses were asked to evaluate the new nurses using the same competency evaluation tool. Initially, the researcher targeted 30 new staff nurse respondents but only 24 complied to answer the questionnaires provided by the researchers. There were 7 respondents who were the head nurses of the new nursing personnel. The 7 head nurses were asked to evaluate the new nurses under their supervision according to their level of competence by using the tool. Findings show that the mean age fell at 23 years old. Most of the nurses were female (54.17% of the total sample). Most of the respondents are single (95.83%) and college students without MA units and most are without previous experience.

Indoor air purifier (IAP) has been developed by various companies worldwide to address indoor air pollution. The manufacturers of these air purifiers rarely concentrate in controlling the rotation speed of the fan which results in the use of traditional control techniques wherein some still relies on human intervention. In this paper, Fuzzy Logic (FL) was applied to control the rotation speed of the fan of an indoor air purifier. The system automatically maintains a suitable fan speed based on the fuzzy values generated on the current environmental condition. The series of testing conducted using the system showed a very high accuracy in the interpretation of dust concentration to its equivalent Air Quality Index (AQI) levels of health concern. For each detected AQI, the system was able to regulate the voltage coming into a motor that controls the speed of the fan.

,Business establishments | Business representative | Cloud computing | Dynamic programming | Euclidean distance | Graph theory | Mobile application,0,Castillo R.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. There are many products that can be delivered like water, LPG, rice, etc. and people are most likely to request for delivery whenever possible because it is very convenient. Small-scale businesses that offer delivery services already have access to smart phones, but there is no application yet that can help them in handling deliveries efficiently specially the fastest route for multiple customer delivery. With the trend of mobile applications and advancement of technology, the researchers have conceptualized this study to address the issue. This study focuses on the analysis, design, and development of EzDelivery implementing Held-Karp and Fixed-Radius Near Neighbors algorithms. This mobile application helps small-scale business in handling their deliveries and allows them to know the fastest delivery route. Furthermore, the application allows customers to easily locate nearby businesses and order products conveniently. For the route suggestion, Held-Karp algorithm was used to show the fastest rate with better time complexity than brute force algorithm. On the other hand, fixed-radius near neighbors algorithm was used to locate the nearby establishments because of its effectiveness in attaining the mobile application‟s functionality. During the testing, the application was able to retrieve the nearby establishments based on the customer‟s delivery location and it also gave the fastest delivery route with turn-by-turn navigation and instruction. To check the acceptance level of the application, the researchers conducted a survey derived from ISO 25010. For the customers, the average rating is 4.49 and an average of 4.65 rating for the business establishments which are both interpreted as highly acceptable. Therefore, the application met the project objectives and satisfied the ISO 25010 standards.",SCOPUS_ID:85066930367,Ezdelivery: A mobile delivery application applying fixed radius near neighbors and held-karp algorithms,2-s2.0-85066930367,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1145/3322645.3322699,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450361033'}]",,,140-144,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066930367,Part F148384,,cp,Conference Paper

,Compliance | Data privacy | E-governance | Local government units,0,Pitogo V.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. The proliferation of ICT in the government sector is a crucial tactic in achieving different dimensions of public trust and services, especially that government offices and local government units (LGUs) are gearing toward e-governance as a way to manage and utilize ICT infrastructure. Moreover, in engaging ICT services, personal data and other critical information must be safeguarded and not exposed publicly. In the Philippines, data privacy act of 2012 (DPA 2012) was promulgated to vanguard sensitive information and data protection, and impose legal sanctions to any organization breached therein. This empirical study aims to explore LGUs on their commitment to data privacy, assess their level of compliance and examine factors that hinder their defiance. The method used is qualitative research in a case study technique, using a multiple case holistic design. Outcomes pattern matching is also used to triangulate records against expected patterns. Results show that before the enactment of DPA 2012, the LGUs under study are not compliant. However, after the passage and the National Privacy Commission (NPC) took action, a significant leap has observed. Determinants of compliance, such as deterrence, legitimacy and moral obligation have compelling casual factors why LGUs are complying with the law. Upon further assessment, pressing concerns are also perceived, such as lack of awareness, wait-and-see attitude, and resource and time constraints. In sum, LGUs are trying to fast-track, overhaul or re-engineering their processes and operations, including ICT infrastructure acquisition, resource allocation, and qualified ICT personnel apportionment as compliance initiatives; and commit themselves to full compliance towards the establishment of better government and e-governance.",SCOPUS_ID:85066631739,Commitment on data privacy towards e-governance: The case of local government units,2-s2.0-85066631739,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1145/3326365.3326404,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781450366441'}]",,,302-309,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066631739,Part F148155,,cp,Conference Paper

Cryptography is one of the best methods to keep the information safe from security attack by unauthorized people. At present, many studies had been conducted to generate a more robust cryptographic algorithm to provide high security for data communication. In this study, the authors proposed an enhanced key security of Playfair cipher algorithm using Playfair cipher 16x16 matrix, XOR, two’s complement, and bit swapping. The result of the study shows that the processing time for encryption and decryption processes are linearly proportional. It means the longer characters of the key; the more significant times needed to encrypt and decrypt the key. Also, the proposed method is faster than the existing key security of Playfair cipher algorithm.

,Data-mule scheduling | Distance vector routing | Network layer | Nodal delay | Queuing delay | Wireless sensor network,1,Alba F.,"© 2019 Kohat University of Science and Technology. Nodal delay in wireless sensor network is an indisputable factor in the medium of communication. Factor such as changeability of communication devices, network topologies, packet-sizes, and transmission rate demands to develop data-mule queue scheduling technique. Our proposed data-mule scheduling technique accomplish this through simulations using standard software written in C# by controlling data-mule schedules that collects data from all the nodes connected to the hop. The scheme identifies the hierarchical positions of static source nodes and the distance of mobile source nodes from the hop with rescheduling based on the newly acquired distances. Source nodes applied with data-mule scheduling technique resulted to lower nodal delay. Transmission of packet-data is efficiently and effectively improved.",SCOPUS_ID:85065513099,A distance-based data-mule scheduling technique for lesser nodal delay in wireless sensor network,2-s2.0-85065513099,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,20760930,1,134-139,International Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065513099,11,,ar,Article
,Cost and return analysis | Market channel | Profitability | Return on investment | Sweet potato production,0,Lirag M.,"© 2019 Insight Society. Sweet potato has found its niche in the global market and is now outpacing other primary staple foods not only because of its desirability for human consumption but as an immediate source of income as well. A study was conducted to examine the factors affecting the profitability of sweet potato production in Camarines Sur, Philippines. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the 108 farmer-respondents. A structured questionnaire and focused group discussion were used as main tools for gathering data. Frequency counts, weighted means and percentages were used to describing and analyzing the socio-demographic data. Cost and return analysis and return on investment were used to determine the profitability of sweet potato production. The factors affecting the profitability of sweet potato production were also evaluated using multiple regression analysis. Results revealed that sweet potato production is generally profitable with the high financial return of 144% to farmers, or a net income of Php 48,400.00 pesos per hectare. There exist a positive relationship between income and farm size, labor input cost, cost of other inputs and access to buyers but inverse relationship exist between income and years of experience and tenurial status. Furthermore, farm size and cost of other inputs are significant variables that contribute to the increase in income. Recommendations include stabilizing the pricing system for sweet potato through the formation of production clusters to improve their market opportunities; provision of seminars and workshops on product development; provision of subsidies on agricultural inputs to reduce the cost of production; provision of basic and high-technology infrastructure; and establishment of an information network on the agricultural market.",SCOPUS_ID:85065499759,"Determinants of profitability of sweet potato production in Camarines Sur, Philippines",2-s2.0-85065499759,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.18517/ijaseit.9.2.7520,,20885334,2,467-472,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065499759,9,,ar,Article
,Feature detectors | Multilayer perceptron | Pattern recognition | Self-organizing maps,0,Cordel M.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. A classifier with self-organizing maps (SOM) as feature detectors resembles the biological visual system learning mechanism. Each SOM feature detector is defined over a limited domain of viewing condition, such that its nodes instantiate the presence of an object's part in the corresponding domain. The weights of the SOM nodes are trained via competition, similar to the development of the visual system. We argue that to approach human pattern recognition performance, we must look for a more accurate model of the visual system, not only in terms of the architecture, but also on how the node connections are developed, such as that of the SOM's feature detectors. This work characterizes SOM as feature detectors to test the similarity of its response vis-á-vis the response of the biological visual system, and to benchmark its performance vis-á-vis the performance of the traditional feature detector convolution filter. We use various input environments i.e. inputs with limited patterns, inputs with various input perturbation and inputs with complex objects, as test cases for evaluation.",SCOPUS_ID:85065027158,Characterizing the SOM feature detectors under various input conditions,2-s2.0-85065027158,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-16142-2_12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783030161415'}]",03029743,,144-155,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065027158,11441 LNAI,,cp,Conference Paper
,Fish object localization,0,Labao A.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. We propose a deep learning tool to localize fish objects in benthic underwater videos on a frame by frame basis. The deep network predicts fish object spatial coordinates and simultaneously segments the corresponding pixels of each fish object. The network follows a state of the art inception resnet v2 architecture that automatically generates informative features for object localization and mask segmentation tasks. Predicted masks are passed to dense Conditional Random Field (CRF) post-processing for contour and shape refinement. Unlike prior methods that rely on motion information to segment fish objects, our proposed method only requires RGB video frames to predict both box coordinates and object pixel masks. Independence from motion information makes our proposed model more robust to camera movements or jitters, and makes it more applicable to process underwater videos taken from unmanned water vehicles. We test the model in actual benthic underwater video frames taken from ten different sites. The proposed tool can segment fish objects despite wide camera movements, blurred underwater resolutions, and is robust to a wide variety of environments and fish species shapes.",SCOPUS_ID:85064531694,Simultaneous Localization and Segmentation of Fish Objects Using Multi-task CNN and Dense CRF,2-s2.0-85064531694,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-14799-0_52,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783030147983'}]",03029743,,600-612,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064531694,11431 LNAI,,cp,Conference Paper

,Multilayer perceptron neural network | Performance analysis | Rainfall forecasting,0,Velasco L.,"© 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is considered as one of the most efficient forecasting techniques which can be implemented for the prediction of weather occurrence. As with any machine learning implementation, the challenge on the utilization of MLPNN in rainfall forecasting lies in the development and evaluation of MLPNN models which delivers optimal forecasting performance. This research conducted performance analysis of MLPNN models through data preparation, model designing, and model evaluation in order to determine which parameters are the best-fit configurations for MLPNN model implementation in rainfall forecasting. During rainfall data preparation, imputation process and spatial correlation evaluation of weather variables from various weather stations showed that the geographical location of the chosen weather stations did not have a direct correlation between stations with respect to rainfall behavior leading to the decision of utilizing the weather station having the most complete weather data to be fed in the MLPNN. By conducting performance analysis of MLPNN models with different combinations of training algorithms, activation functions, learning rate, and momentum, it was found out that MLPNN model having 100 hidden neurons with Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm and Sigmoid activation function delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.031537 while another MLPNN model having the same number of hidden neurons, the same activation function but Resilient Propagation as training algorithm had the lowest MAE of 0.0209.

,Computer-aided manufacturing | Numerical Control | Optimization | Traveling salesman problem,0,Leapheng U.,"© The Authors. The numerical control (NC) codes generated from Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software follow the sequence of adding elements to the design. As an alternative, it would be quite beneficial in cost-reduction to optimize the manufacturing sequence to minimize the run time. Accordingly, this paper introduces a novel approach to optimize the numerical control codes generated from a CAM software package using a systematic block management method. To improve the drilling sequence, contours are also considered as block entities in a traveling salesman problem (TSP) with modifications to systematically manage the blocks of code that define the contours. A MATLAB program was created to automatically optimize the numerical codes from a CAM software translator. Because of easier usage and good performance, a partitioned approach for the λ-opt algorithm was implemented instead of the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic (LKH) that has been extensively proven to be effective in optimizing the traveling salesman problem. The new approach was simulated on sample designs and has been shown to achieve at least 15.52% reduction in airtime and 11.32% reduction in tool travel distance.

Numerous innovations in the field of biomedical engineering include the use of synthetic polymers as a drug carrier for drug delivery systems. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), with its properties of being a biocompatible, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic polymer, were infused into nata de coco, a bacterial cellulose, by immersing nata de coco slabs into PVA solutions to investigate its capability as a component in drug delivery systems. Different PVA concentrations were prepared to see any effect to the bacterial cellulose. The composites were characterized by analyzing the functional groups present, water uptake capacity and kinetics of methylene blue release. Effect of varying PVA concentration was not seen due to inconsistent amount of pure bacterial cellulose and water on tested samples. Study on the kinetics of methylene blue, modeled as a drug, loaded into the nata de coco/PVA composite was analyzed using Power Law Model. Results showed that the governing diffusion mechanism involved in the release of methylene blue from the composite samples were mainly ‘non-Fickian (anomalous). Tests performed, confirmed the capability of PVA to reinforce the bacterial cellulose matrix. Results showed that composites with high amount of PVA in their matrix released smaller amounts of methylene blue. Results showed that composites with high amount of PVA in their matrix released smaller amounts of methylene blue.

Movies that are publicly exhibited in the Philippine Cinema, regardless if produced locally (local films) and/or outside the country (foreign films) undergo a thorough evaluation before public exhibition to properly identify suited audiences. There are many factors that contribute to the classification and rating of a specific movie. Movies play a vital role for Filipino culture as for some people; these serve as their leisure activity, for other people, these are not just a leisure activity instead a form of visual art that may send important messages to the audiences and/or may re-enact human personal experiences. It is very important that movie(s) will be classified accordingly without any form of biases. This paper promotes a Decision Support System that can be used in predicting movie classification and rating using historically evaluated movies from 2010 to 2017.

Refractive index variations caused by temperature or pressure gradients in transparent fluids are invisible to the naked eye. Schlieren effect reveals this variation using refraction and the knife-edge method. High contrast schlieren images are important in the analyses of fluid flow, gas density, shockwaves, heat transfer, flames, ballistics, leak detection and other applications. The neglect of physical or wave theory in schlieren technique leads to erroneous results in some circumstance. Specifically, a study had mathematically shown that illumination is fairly uniform over large part of the field but suddenly increases at the edge and is fairly appreciable for some way outside the actual physical boundary of the aperture. This bright edge is noticeable in all schlieren systems whereas a geometrical optics would lead to a uniformly illuminated field. Geometric ray-tracing codes are useful for optical design, but they cannot describe the key role of diffraction in the formation of schlieren image. In this study, a wave propagation-based model of the schlieren technique is proposed. Compared to the ray optics approach, the proposed model provides valuable insights and visualization of fluid flow dynamics.

In the field of ubiquitous computing, machines need to be aware of the present context to enable anticipatory communication with humans. This leads to human-centric applications that have the primary objective of improving the Quality-of-Life (QoL) of its users. One important type of context information for these applications is the current activity of the user, which can be derived from environmental and wearable sensors. Due to the processing capabilities and the number of sensors embedded in a smartphone, this device exhibits the most promise among other existing technologies in human activity recognition (HAR) research. While machine learning-based solutions have been successful in past HAR studies, several design struggles can be easily resolved with deep learning. In this paper, we investigated Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks in dealing with common challenges in smartphone-based HAR, such as device location and subject dependency, and manual feature extraction. We showed that the CNN model accomplished location- and subject-independent recognition with overall accuracy of 98.38% and 90.61%, respectively.

,Enterprise Resource Planning system | Sales Module | Sap Business One | Single usability measure | Usability design,1,Polancos R.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. The importance of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in modern business has created a demand for ERP consultants with the appropriate competencies to implement, maintain and support these systems such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. However, users of these systems encounter usability issues whilst learning to use the systems. Several studies have shown that the assessed user interface of these ERP systems resulted to poor usability and user dissatisfaction. Empirical studies on the usability of ERP systems, particularly for SAP B1 are limited on determining the critical success factors. This paper reports on the usability assessment of SAP B1 which investigates on the effects of the external dependent variables such as buttons, labels or terminologies, navigation, layout colors, user help and logical process. The experiment results provide considerable insights into the usability design issues of the SAP B1 Sales Module. Results were assessed by measuring the efficiency effectiveness and satisfaction followed by computing for their corresponding Single Usability Metric (SUM) for benchmarking. Thus, from the usability results of the redesigned user interface, there was a significant improvement on the sigma level.",SCOPUS_ID:85052317947,A Usability Study of an Enterprise Resource Planning System: A Case Study on SAP Business One,2-s2.0-85052317947,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_121,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960708'}]",21945357,,1203-1223,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052317947,824,,cp,Conference Paper
,Affective design | Structural equation model | Usability,0,Seva R.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. In this study, a design framework that integrates functional and aesthetic attributes with apparent usability and affective quality was validated using prototypes. The framework was validated using a mobile phone which is a high involvement product. Product attributes that affected visual evaluation prior to usage were selected and categorized into functional and aesthetic attributes. Nine design alternatives were generated out of varied functional and aesthetic design attributes. A survey was used to evaluated each design alternative in terms of the pre-purchase dimensions of affective quality, apparent usability, and desirability. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to validate the design framework. After conducting the experiment, the model obtained has a good fit and the relationships were significant. It was found that affective quality has the greatest direct effect on desirability and apparent usability has the greatest total effect on desirability. Functional attributes have significant total effects on apparent usability and desirability. For comparative analysis, older people’s perception on functional attributes have a greater effect on apparent usability, affective quality and desirability. Finally, it can be said that apparent usability evokes more emotions for people having greater usability needs such as older people.",SCOPUS_ID:85052315006,The effect of age to the perception of apparent usability and affective quality on prototype mobile phones,2-s2.0-85052315006,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_216,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960708'}]",21945357,,2067-2076,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052315006,824,,cp,Conference Paper
,Engineering | Engineering problem | Human factors curriculum,0,Seva R.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Engineers are expected to design systems and products for human use. However, the curriculums of most engineering courses do not include a course on human factors. Thus, engineers design products and systems considering only the technical aspects. This results in usability problems and poor performance in the market. This paper discusses some of the problems in designing buildings and workplace environments such as lack of thermal comfort, excessive illumination, poor layout, confusing design of controls, etc. A framework for integrating human factors in designing built environments will be proposed that will include a system for various engineering disciplines to communicate and consider the needs of the users at different stages of the design process.",SCOPUS_ID:85052305550,Integrating creativity and human factors in the design of engineering curriculums,2-s2.0-85052305550,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_68,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960708'}]",21945357,,649-652,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052305550,824,,cp,Conference Paper
,Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) | Environmentally Conscious Quality Function Deployment (ECQFD) | Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ),0,Gutierrez A.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. The use of plastic bags has a negative environment impact, and other alternatives such as paper bags, boxes and current eco-bags proved to have a short lifetime. Due to the problems encountered by consumers in current calico eco-bags in supermarkets, there is a need to redesign the eco-bags. This study focused on an improved design for calico eco-bags which considers different customer needs in terms of its function and ergonomics aspect. The main concern of this study was to address the problem with regards to the eco-bag’s water resistance, presence of dividers, ease of cleaning, and durability. An environmentally conscious product development methodology which was integration of Environmentally Conscious Quality Function Deployment (ECQFD), Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to select the best design which addresses the problem with current calico eco-bags. The effectiveness of the prototype was tested in terms of its performance and usability. Based on the conducted tests and survey, the prototype was able to address not only the main concerns of consumers, but the minor problem as well. The satisfaction rating of all the customer needs, except for the weight, obtained a lesser value compared to the satisfaction rating of the current eco-bags in the market. This proves that the prototype is better than the current eco-bags.

,Auditory ergonomics | Call center agents | Fuzzy Data Envelopment Risk Analysis,0,Go E.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Most contact center employees experience work related injuries, leading to decreased productivity and performance. The increased risk is due to poor workstation design, such as indecent noise level and duration exposure experienced by call center agents daily, while receiving and making calls on a headset or telephone. Some illnesses caused by prolonged exposure to unfavorable acoustics are headaches, increased anxiety levels, tinnitus, and noise-induced hearing loss. Mathematical modelling has only been applied in optimizing systems considering musculoskeletal disorders and only in other industries. Thus, it is important to consider the auditory ergonomic risks faced by call center agents mathematically. This study proposes Fuzzy Data Envelopment Risk Analysis (FDERA), a DEA-based risk analysis tool that considers the presence of imprecise data. The validity of the model is demonstrated using a case example. The results of the proposed tool are relative risk efficiency scores for each agent. Guidelines for interventions to improve risk efficiencies are presented using a matrix that provides possible preventive and corrective measures to address risks.",SCOPUS_ID:85051779432,Development of fuzzy data envelopment risk analysis applied on auditory ergonomics for call center agents in the Philippines,2-s2.0-85051779432,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96059-3_2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960586'}]",21945357,,13-22,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051779432,827,,cp,Conference Paper
,Healthcare workers | Musculoskeletal disorder | Patient handling device,2,Robielos R.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Over the years, healthcare workers have suffered debilitating musculoskeletal disorders when lifting, transferring and repositioning patients manually. Hence this study focuses on risk-related issues experienced by healthcare workers as well as their patients due to manual patient handling. Issues regarding patient handling activities were analyzed by conducting a survey on healthcare workers and patients that includes ergonomic assessment tools like Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), NIOSH Lifting Equation, and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) etc. After which, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD Test were conducted to determine a significant difference between the risk factors on patient handling activities. As a result, healthcare workers tend to experience discomfort mostly on their upper limbs due to equipment’s dimensions and capacity to lift. To address the problem, this study suggested an intervention for the most critical patient handling activity by proposing a patient handling device. The design of the device was based on healthcare workers and patients’ needs and requirements which were translated using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Detail Design. For validation of the product, Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) and survey regarding user’s perspective of the product were conducted. To test the effectiveness of the proposed design, RULA and NIOSH Lifting Equation were also utilized and the results were compared to the ones obtained before the intervention. Through this, it was confirmed that the proposed design captures critical patient handling activities and offers more functions and features than the available lifting equipment with a lower cost.",SCOPUS_ID:85051776924,Ergonomic intervention for healthcare workers and patients: A development of patient handling device,2-s2.0-85051776924,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96083-8_80,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960821'}]",21945357,,615-638,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051776924,820,,cp,Conference Paper
,CDMQ | Musculoskeletal disorders | Orthodontics | REBA,3,Borres R.,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) prevalence was highest among the orthodontists and oral physicians compared to the general population working in different environments. This study aims to explore ergonomic issues in the orthodontic workplace in small to medium-scale dental clinics in Metro Manila. Assessments were made on the physical workstation set-up of the orthodontic clinic – the design, equipment, tools/instruments, environmental hazards, and the manner in which the workers perform their tasks. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Generic Job Stress Questionnaire were used to gather critical information about MSDs. Anthropometric measurements were taken and used in the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) to determine the most risky orthodontic tasks. It was found that all orthodontists reported body pains and the highest occurrence had been in the neck (87%), lower back (87%), shoulders (83%), upper back (80%), and forearms (77%). The factors significantly associated with the discomfort scores were age, weekly working hours, workload, and posture. Among the tasks most commonly performed, tooth extraction puts the orthodontists at the highest risk of developing MSDs. To reduce the prevalence of MSDs symptoms among Filipino orthodontists, some of the ergonomic interventions are (1) designing ergonomic workstations to better fit the population, (2) employing certain administrative controls and (3) modifying how tasks are performed.",SCOPUS_ID:85051761402,Musculoskeletal disorders among orthodontists: Risk factors and ergonomic intervention,2-s2.0-85051761402,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-96083-8_87,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319960821'}]",21945357,,709-733,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051761402,820,,cp,Conference Paper
,Anthropometry | Boatmen | Ergonomic design | Outrigger canoe,0,Capulong M.,"© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019. In the Philippines, the bangka or outrigger canoe was used daily by fisherfolk to transport and stow their catch. As the tourism industry flourished in the country, these bangkas were used to ferry tourists to islands to explore the country. The bangkas’ abrupt conversion to a tourist ferry has led to difficulties, especially for the driver, brought about by the traditional design giving value to practicality, not comfort. A tourist boat that properly accommodates the optimal seating position of the passengers is imperative to sustain the development of the tourism industry in the country. This study aims to design an ergonomic bangka using anthropometric data and other ergonomic design. The tourist boat would allow the bangkeros to have better posture and reduce the possible occurrence or development of work related musculoskeletal disorders, with materials that are cheap, durable, and easily attainable to best suit the business.",SCOPUS_ID:85049695085,"Designing an Ergonomic Tourist Boat in Taal Lake, Talisay, Philippines",2-s2.0-85049695085,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93885-1_25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319938844'}]",21945357,,274-280,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049695085,786,,cp,Conference Paper

The number of registered private vehicles in the Philippines increases by 300 to 400 thousand per year, with around 9.2 million vehicles registered and 5.8 million licenses and permits issued in 2016. One of the factors that plays an important role in the comfort of the driver is the car seat. Previous studies have shown that driving for more than 4Â h may induce body pains such as lower back, neck, and foot pain. This study investigates the possible mismatch between the driver seat specifications and anthropometric measurement of Filipinos. Five of the most common car models sold in the Philippines were chosen. Specification of the driver seats were measured and compared to Filipino anthropometric measurements. In addition, driver discomfort was also examined by performing surveys to drivers of the selected car models using the Nordic Questionnaire and likert scale comfortability rating. Common problematic parts for all car models are the seat length, headrest height, and legroom (also represented as distance from seat to pedals for anthropometric analysis) which were consistent for all evaluation tools used: anthropometric assessment, Nordic Questionnaire, and Comfortability rating.",SCOPUS_ID:85049690242,An Ergonomic Assessment of the Driver Seat of Common Car Models in the Philippines,2-s2.0-85049690242,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93885-1_82,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319938844'}]",21945357,,878-884,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049690242,786,,cp,Conference Paper

The use of a navigation device is essential to the work of Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) drivers. The Anti-Distracted Driving Act in the Philippines prohibits distracted driving on any public thoroughfare, highway, or street. However, it only considers the driver’s horizontal line of sight and does not specify the ideal location of the navigation device. This study involves ‘Uber’ drivers, which were asked to test three different locations for the navigation device: left side of the steering wheel, speedometer area, and right side of the steering wheel. The driver’s distraction level was measured using a Peripheral Detection Test with four light-switch mechanisms.

,Airport announcement | Intelligibility | Signal-to-Noise Ratio,0,Cohen M.,"© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019. Nearly all airport passengers’ journeys rely on the public address (PA) system through which information is given to provide real-time announcements accessible to all. This information is important and time-sensitive, but easy to miss or misunderstand. In an effort to improve the effectiveness of passenger information dissemination in an International Airport in the Philippines, a study on the airport’s PA announcements was conducted. Specific areas of the airport where PA announcements are vital were identified. A survey of passenger perception of audibility and intelligibility of announcements was conducted. In addition, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for different locations was measured and compared to recommended levels. Out of the 405 survey respondents, 42% were able to hear and correctly recall important parts of the most recent announcement, 25% were able to hear that an announcement was aired, but were unable to correctly recall what was announced, and 33% responded that they were not aware that any announcements were aired within the past ten minutes prior to their receiving of the questionnaire.

,Ergonomic evaluation | Kalesa assessment | Postural analysis,0,Montefalcon M.,"© 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. The kalesa (horse-drawn carriage), one of the earliest modes of transportation in the Philippines, has since become a Filipino cultural heritage and tourist attraction in some parts of the country. Kalesa drivers (kutseros) may be subject to pain at work as they are exposed to awkward postures and long work hours. This research serves as a preliminary study to assess the suitability of kalesas for the kutseros. Eighteen kutseros in Intramuros, Manila were asked to participate in the study. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was used to determine pain perceived by each kutsero. In addition, Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) was conducted to evaluate their work postures and identify the level of work-related musculoskelated disorder (WMSD) risk the kutseros are exposed to. Furthermore, relevant kalesa measurements were obtained and compared against the standards. NMQ results showed that hand and back pains were prevalent among the kutseros, while REBA scores indicated medium to high risks of WMSD. Results also showed that measurements of the kalesa steps and seats were unsuitable for the kutseros. Improvements based on ergonomic standards were suggested to reduce REBA scores, that can consequently reduce discomfort among the kutseros.",SCOPUS_ID:85049642665,An Ergonomic Assessment of the Philippine Kalesa,2-s2.0-85049642665,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-94484-5_18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319944838'}]",21945357,,170-178,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049642665,789,,cp,Conference Paper

School transport service (STS) conductors, more commonly known as school bus conductors, ensure the safety and welfare of students during their travel to school, and back to their respective homes. Their tasks involve manual labor, exposing them to risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Hence, it is imperative to assess and improve their working conditions. A total of 24 subjects from three different schools in Metro Manila, Philippines, with at least one year of work experience, were interviewed and observed. A modified Nordic Questionnaire was used to identify the work-related musculoskeletal symptoms (WMSSs) the conductors have experienced over the past 12 months. Postures were documented, and the corresponding risk factors were assessed using Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). The results of the study showed that 91.67% of school transport service conductors have perceived WMSSs, and that majority of their work postures were categorized as having high risk levels.",SCOPUS_ID:85049624332,Postural Analysis on Manual Materials Handling Tasks and Prevalence of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Symptoms Among Filipino School Transport Service Conductors,2-s2.0-85049624332,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-94484-5_30,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319944838'}]",21945357,,286-296,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049624332,789,,cp,Conference Paper

Fuzzy C-Means is a clustering algorithm known to suffer from slow processing time. One factor affecting this algorithm is on the selection of appropriate distance measure. While this drawback was addressed with the use of the Manhattan distance measure, this sacrifice its accuracy over processing time. In this study, a new approach to distance measurement is explored to answer both the speed and accuracy issues of Fuzzy C-Means incorporating trigonometric functions to Manhattan distance calculation. Upon application of the new approach for clustering of the Iris dataset, processing time was reduced by three iterations over the use of Euclidean distance. Improvement in accuracy was also observed with 50% and 78% improvement over the use of Euclidean and Manhattan distances respectively. The results provide clear proof that the new distance measurement approach was able to address both the slow processing time and accuracy problems associated with Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm.",SCOPUS_ID:85049576101,Enhanced manhattan-based clustering using fuzzy C-means algorithm,2-s2.0-85049576101,City,undefined,"City, University of London",0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93692-5_13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319936918'}]",21945357,,126-134,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049576101,769,,cp,Conference Paper

,Bus signage | Legibility | Readability | Signage,0,Gonzales J.,"© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019. In the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of commuters ride the buses that traverse the Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue (EDSA) daily. There are various bus stops officially established along the route. However, an observable majority of the bus drivers do not comply with these stops due to several factors such as commuter demands, traffic conditions, and convenience. In lieu of this, they make use of destination signs to indicate where the bus will stop along the thoroughfare. The problem with these makeshift signs is that they do not have a standard format in terms of signage size, font, font size, and color. These destination signs often come in a variety of neon colors that are difficult to read. This study aims to improve the legibility and readability of the bus signage to enhance the conditions of the bus system by designing a standard signage for all buses in the metropolis. Eight combinations of three factors, namely font, case, and color combination were utilized to determine the appropriate attributes that form the signage. Each factor had two variations respectively. An experimental setup was conducted along three bus stops having a high volume of foot traffic along EDSA. The researchers were able to deduce that case and color combinations are significant factors with regard to legibility and readability of these bus signage. The results suggest that the commuters preferred uppercase letters and white text on a dark gray background.",SCOPUS_ID:85049319598,Factors affecting legibility and readability of philippine metropolitan bus signage,2-s2.0-85049319598,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93888-2_15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783319938875'}]",21945357,,131-139,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049319598,796,,cp,Conference Paper

This paper discusses a publication-driven, education-by-research model of engaging undergraduate students in Photonics/Optics/Physics research by requiring that all activities lead to journal publication within a year. It is based on a non-traditional university-industry collaboration arrangement that has the following unique features. First, it utilizes offshore-based alumni (in the USA) who are active in science and technology research as mentors for the students (in the Philippines) in conjunction with the university professor advisers. We adopt inexpensive online collaboration technologies to support their virtual presence. Second, our research topic ""fuses"" uniquely two separate courses of study, namely: (i) the traditional Special Relativity in Physics and (ii) the fast emerging Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), into an innovative research area we have called ""Special-Relativity-on-a-Chip"". It has the flavor of physics education combined with a taste of the latest in PICs technology. It enhances the textbook understanding of Physics/Engineering while providing potential publication opportunities. Third, the research activities are focused mainly on modelling, simulations and design. These activities strengthen students' learning since they concentrate on and master specific mathematical/Physics/programming skills. The goal of the project is to publish 5 journal papers, and so far, (i) 3 journal papers have been published, (ii) 1 international conference paper has been accepted for oral presentation, and (iii) 3 national conference papers have been submitted for publication.",SCOPUS_ID:85072912197,Engaging undergraduate students in the Philippines in photonics research with a novel publication-driven online mentoring approach,2-s2.0-85072912197,,undefined,,1,True,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.1117/12.2523856,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9781510629790'}]",0277786X,,,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072912197,11143,,cp,Conference Paper
,,2,Fortun N.,"© 2019 University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science. All rights reserved. The Deficiency Zero Theorem (DZT) provides definitive results about the dynamical behavior of chemical reaction networks with deficiency zero. Thus far, the available DZTs only apply to classes of power-law kinetic systems with reactant-determined interactions (i.e., the kinetic order vectors of the branching reactions of a reactant complex are identical). In this paper, we present the first DZT valid for a class of power-law systems with non-reactant-determined interactions (i.e., there are reactant complexes whose branching reactions have different kinetic order vectors). This class of power-law systems is characterized here by a decomposition into subnetworks with specific properties of their stoichiometric and reactant subspaces, as well as their kinetics. We illustrate our results to a power-law system of a pre-industrial carbon cycle model, from which we abstracted the properties of the above-mentioned decomposition. Specifically, our DZT is applied to a subnetwork of the carbon cycle system to describe the subnetwork’s steady states. It is also shown that the qualitative dynamical properties of the subnetwork may be lifted to the entire network of pre-industrial carbon cycle.",SCOPUS_ID:85064401195,A deficiency zero theorem for a class of power–law kinetic systems with non–reactant–determined interactions,2-s2.0-85064401195,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,03406253,3,621-638,Match,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064401195,81,,ar,Article

,Active learning | Classification | Passive learning | Task persistence | Uncertainty sampling,0,Dumdumaya C.,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Selection of high-quality ground truth data is a critical step for machine learning. Conventionally, a human-centered strategy is utilized to label the data. While this technique provides accurate annotations of task-specific behaviors, it is difficult, costly and error-prone. One method explored to solve these problems is active learning, a model-centered approach that minimizes human involvement. In this work, we conduct an experiment to compare the performance of active learning and passive learning strategies in selecting ground truth data for a classification task to detect the incidence of task persistent behavior from students’ interaction logs. Our findings suggest that active learning tends to be more effective and efficient than passive learning in achieving a certain level of performance.

The delineation of water bodies plays a vital role in the study of surface rivers. The objective of this paper is to propose a new method for accurately extracting water bodies from Landsat 8 OLI. The proposed method is implemented by generating two water indices which are the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The two water index was employed because of its proven capacity to address challenges in discriminating water bodies with high levels of turbidity and those with high correlation with dark pixels (e.g., from shadows). We then classified the combined input images using the Minimum Distance classification method.

,Aggressiveness | Bipolaris oryzae | Brown spot | Genetic diversity | Rice,0,Chaijuckam P.,"© 2019 King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok. All Rights Reserved. One hundred and ten isolates of Bipolaris oryzae, the causal agent of rice brown spot disease were collected from paddy fields in four provinces of north-central Thailand, including Ang Thong, Chai Nat, Lop Buri, and Sing Buri. DNA polymorphism of some Bipolaris oryzae isolates was determined by VNTR, ISSR and RAPD markers. Only VNTR-MR primer showed different fingerprint patterns among these isolates, therefore this primer was selected to study genetic diversity of the Bipolaris oryzae population. In total, there were three haplotypes corresponding to the results from cluster analysis; each of the three clusters shared identical haplotype. The majority of the isolates were separated into group A (88.18%), indicating predominant asexual reproduction of clonal population. However, there was no relationship between haplotype and either collection provinces or aggressiveness on rice. Among four rice varieties tested, including Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105), RD31, Pathum Thani 1, and Jao Hom Nin (JHN), JHN was the most resistant variety, while KDML 105 was the most susceptible to brown spot disease.",SCOPUS_ID:85076686177,Genetic Diversity and Aggressiveness of Bipolaris oryzae in North-Central Thailand,2-s2.0-85076686177,KURDI,R.M.6-57,Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.14416/j.asep.2019.03.004,,26729156,2,116-125,Applied Science and Engineering Progress,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076686177,12,,ar,Article
,Bipolaris oryzae | Brown spot | Defense mechanism | Gene expression | Rice,0,Songkumarn P.,"© 2019 King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok. All Rights Reserved. The rice defense mechanism was studied against Bipolaris oryzae, the rice brown spot fungus, in two Thai rice varieties, Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) and Jao Hom Nin (JHN) (showing highest and lowest susceptibility to B. oryzae, respectively). The expression was evaluated of eight genes through real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The gene involved in the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway (OsPAL) and the pathogenesis related genes (OsPR1b and OsPBZ1) were upregulated in both varieties with no significant differences. Despite higher expression of the genes involved in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway (OsLOX and OsAOS2) in JHN, the expression of JiOsPR10 was not significantly different in both varieties. The genes involved in the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway (OsACS1 and OsEIN2) were expressed more highly and far more rapidly in KDML 105 than JHN. Overall, our results demonstrated that the investigated genes related to SA, JA and ET defense pathways may not play a major role in rice resistance against B. oryzae. Furthermore, the high level of transcript accumulation of genes related to the ET signaling pathway may interfere with the ability of rice to resist B. oryzae.

This study examined the effect of modifying chitosan (MC) with sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) in adsorbing soluble cutting fluid emulsion (SCFE). The adsorbent was prepared by the addition of SLES to chitosan solution followed by sulfuric acid immersion. Batch adsorption was carried out as a function of initial concentration of the soluble cutting fluid emulsion. The point of zero charge of the adsorbent was also measured at pH 1.9. The percent adsorption was calculated and found out to decrease, whereas the adsorption capacity increases as the initial concentration of the adsorbate increases. Experimental results showed that using 2.0 g of the modified chitosan in a 72,227 mg/L soluble cutting fluid emulsion concentration, a 2,518.8 mg/g adsorption capacity was calculated. Models of Langmuir and Freundlich were applied to describe the adsorption isotherm together with coefficient of determination and chi-square error function calculations. The Langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data of the modified chitosan. In addition, the significant uptake of the soluble cutting fluid emulsion was demonstrated by the changes in the FTIR spectra and the heat of combustion of the modified chitosan before and after the adsorption process.",SCOPUS_ID:85076674170,Adsorption soluble cutting fluid emulsion by modified chitosan with SLES,2-s2.0-85076674170,KMUTNB,undefined,King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.14416/j.asep.2019.11.003,,26729156,4,243-252,Applied Science and Engineering Progress,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076674170,12,,ar,Article

,Bangsamoro conflict | Jihad | Modernist Islamic perspective | Southern Philippines,0,Lantong A.,"© 2019 Jour of Adv Research in Dynamical and Control Systems. All rights reserved. As the founder and ideologue of the contemporary Islamic revival vanguard in the Southern Philippines, the views of ShaykhSalamatHashim on jihad (armed struggle) have profoundly influenced the course of the decadesold armed resistance movement in the Southern Philippines. Despite his advocacy on a peaceful resolution to the Bangsamoro conflict, his real motive has been hotly debated among scholars and political observers. Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine and analyze Hashim’s views on jihad, using Modernist Islamic theory. Hashim’s views on jihad included his views on the nature of jihad, shari’ah ruling on it, its legitimacy, objectives, enemies, ethics and its termination. In view of this, the article found that in resolving the Bangsamoro question, Hashim viewed peace, not war, as Islam's primary policy. In fact, Hashim strongly emphasized that jihad in the form of armed fighting is for self-defense against aggression, oppression, persecution and injustice. Thus, for him, jihad as a defensive or self-defense is an essential mechanism of Islam for the survival of the Muslim Ummah, in general, and the Bangsamoro community, in particular.",SCOPUS_ID:85071847192,Modernist Islamic Perspective: Assessing Bangsamoro Jihad in the Southern Philippines,2-s2.0-85071847192,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,,8 Special Issue,133-141,Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071847192,11,,ar,Article

,Mechanical properties | SFRC | SIFCON | Silica fume | Steel fiber,0,Abd-Ali M.,"© 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved. In recent decades, many methods and new construction materials have been utilized to ameliorate the mechanical properties of concrete, one of which is slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (sifcon). Sifcon built-updiverge from a conventional steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) in two respects: it contains a volume fraction of fibers (usually 5 to 20 volume percent), and it uses a matrix consisting of very fine particles (absence of coarse aggregates). The experimental work had been implemented for studying two aspects. The first aspect was the study of mechanical properties of Sifcon with variation of steel fiber ratio (6%, 7.5%, and 9%) and the second aspect with variation of silica fume (100,150 and 200)kg/m3 by using (165 specimens) .165 samples were tested as follows:-66 cubes, 33cylinders, 33pirsms and 33double L shape for the purposes of deterring of compressive, tensile, flexural and shear strength respectively. The study included the use of two types of steel fiber with two aspect ratios with different lengths (6mm and 3.5 mm), where 6mm was appropriate to penetrate the fiber network. It was found that the concrete mix which contains a percentage of steel fiber by 9% with silica fume 200 kg/m3 gave the best results. Also, it had been shown that the use of steel fiber ratio above 10% is not possible or very difficult during casting Sifcon specimens.",SCOPUS_ID:85070954203,Mechanical properties of slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (SIFCON) with variation steel fiber ratios and silica fume,2-s2.0-85070954203,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,,1 Special Issue,1863-1872,Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070954203,11,,ar,Article
956,Energy level consumption | Level classification | Load forecasting | Machine learning | Pattern recognition | Random forest,0,Chen Y.,"© 2019 by the authors. Energy consumers may not know whether their next-hour forecasted load is either high or low based on the actual value predicted from their historical data. A conventional method of level prediction with a pattern recognition approach was performed by first predicting the actual numerical values using typical pattern-based regression models, hen classifying them into pattern levels (e.g., low, average, and high). A proposed prediction with pattern recognition scheme was developed to directly predict the desired levels using simpler classifier models without undergoing regression. The proposed pattern recognition classifier was compared to its regression method using a similar algorithm applied to a real-world energy dataset. A random forest (RF) algorithm which outperformed other widely used machine learning (ML) techniques in previous research was used in both methods. Both schemes used similar parameters for training and testing simulations. After 10-time cross training validation and five averaged repeated runs with random permutation per data splitting, the proposed classifier shows better computation speed and higher classification accuracy than the conventional method. However, when the number of its desired levels increases, its prediction accuracy seems to decrease and approaches the accuracy of the conventional method. The developed energy level prediction, which is computationally inexpensive and has a good classification performance, can serve as an alternative forecasting scheme.",SCOPUS_ID:85070523597,Energy consumption load forecasting using a level-based random forest classifier,2-s2.0-85070523597,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.3390/sym11080956,,,8,,Symmetry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070523597,11,,ar,Article

A multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach is developed to capture simultaneously the regime-switching dynamics of four financial market indicators: Treasury-Euro Dollar rate spread, US dollar index, volatility index and S&P 500 bid-ask spread. These indicators exhibit stochasticity, mean reversion, spikes and state memory, and they are deemed to drive the main characteristics of liquidity risk and regarded to mirror financial markets' liquidity levels. In this paper, an online system is proposed in which observed indicators are processed and the results are then interfaced with an advanced alert mechanism that gives out appropriate measures. In particular, two stochastic models, with HMM-modulated parameters switching between liquidity regimes, are integrated to capture the evolutions of the four time series or their transformations. Parameter estimation is accomplished by deriving adaptive multivariate filters. Indicators' joint empirical characteristics are captured well and useful early warnings are obtained for occurrence prediction of illiquidity episodes.",SCOPUS_ID:85066091821,An automated financial indices-processing scheme for classifying market liquidity regimes,2-s2.0-85066091821,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1080/00207179.2019.1616225,,00207179,,,International Journal of Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066091821,,,ar,Article
,Optimization techniques | Probabilistic design | Risk and reliability | Safety | Uncertainty,0,Liao K.,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. To search an optimal design under uncertainty, this study proposes an effective framework that integrates the moment-based reliability analysis into a heuristic optimization algorithm. Integration of an equivalent single-variable performance function is an ideal concept to calculate the failure probability. However, such integration is often not available and is alternatively computed using the first four moments and a generalized moment-based reliability index is established, in which the Gaussian–Hermite integration and dimension reduction are implemented to enhance the effectiveness. To overcome the limited applicable range of moment-based approach, an adjustable optimization procedure is proposed, in which different reliability methods are performed depending on results of the constraint assessments. In addition, the ε level comparison is integrated into particle-swarm optimization to consider the constraint violation. Several literature studies are used to verify the accuracy of the proposed optimization framework including problems having linear, highly nonlinear, implicit probabilistic constraint functions with normal or non-normal variables and system-level reliability analysis. The effects of several parameters, such as the number of estimate point, the number of dimension, and the degree of uncertainty, are thoroughly investigated. Results indicating that tri-variate with seven points are able to provide a stable solution under a high degree of uncertainty.",SCOPUS_ID:85065395767,A heuristic moment-based framework for optimization design under uncertainty,2-s2.0-85065395767,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1007/s00366-019-00759-4,,01770667,,,Engineering with Computers,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065395767,,,ar,Article
,China | Contingent liabilities | Corporate leverage | Public debt sustainability | State-owned enterprises,0,Ferrarini B.,"© 2019, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business. The paper aims to combine balance sheet analysis at the firm level with the International Monetary Fund's public debt sustainability assessment framework to assess state-owned enterprises' (SOE) leverage as a contingent liability to the public sector. Based on company data and the interest coverage ratio as a measure of debt at risk, aggregate baseline scenarios are projected to gauge the magnitude of SOE debt as a contingency. SOE's financial and debt ratios are first bootstrapped to generate firm-level distributions and then averaged into a fan chart of the economy-wide SOE contingent liability. Applied to the People's Republic of China as an example, the study finds that by the end of 2015 SOE leverage had grown to a substantial liability. However arbitrary the assumptions underlying these projections, it would appear that even if authorities had to mop up as much as 20% of SOE debt at risk gone bad, this would have been manageable at roughly 2.7% of the gross domestic product in 2016 or 5.5% by 2021. This projection framework is fully amenable to alternative assumptions and settings, which makes it a useful analytical tool to monitor contingent liabilities from non-financial corporate debt that have been building in emerging and advanced economies alike.",SCOPUS_ID:85064909240,State-owned enterprises and debt sustainability analysis: The case of the People's Republic of China,2-s2.0-85064909240,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.13106/jafeb.2019.vol6.no1.91,,22884637,1,91-105,"Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064909240,6,,ar,Article

Spiking Neural P system is a computing model inspired on how the neurons in a living being are interconnected and exchange information. As a model in embrane computing, it is a non-deterministic and massively-parallel system. The latter makes GPU a good candidate for accelerating the simulation of these models. A matrix representation for systems with and without delay have been previously designed, and algorithms for simulating them with deterministic systems was also developed. So far, non-determinism has been problematic for the design of parallel simulators. In this work, an algorithm for simulating non-deterministic spiking neural P system with delays is presented. In order to study how the simulations get accelerated on a GPU, this algorithm was implemented in CUDA and used to simulate non-uniform and uniform solutions to the Subset Sum problem as a case study.

The objective of this study is to extend the application of the spray-coated tactile sensor, ScoTacS, which is being developed by the authors and can be constructed simply by “coating” with a spray gun, from one dimension to two dimensions, and further to configure it into various shapes such as a ring. This sensor is constructed by coating three layers-conductive, piezoelectric, and resistive films-in sequence. It is based on a unique principle by which the contact position is detected from the delay time, i.e., the time difference between the arrivals of peaks in the output signals. As the delay time varies with the contact position, it can be used to estimate the contact position.

The model is supported by its application to multiple interpretative case studies of the Philippine Open Government initiative. It was evidenced that open government data as a technology is subjective—understood and interpreted inconsistently by the government and data users and therefore creates a disconnect between them. Based on the cases presented, it is proposed that a two-way open governance model will be a more effective approach in developing a truly open government. This reinforces the role of user-side stakeholders as they have the interest, expertise, and resources to utilize open data and can therefore build networks with more users within their respective fields that government initiatives may not be able to reach.",SCOPUS_ID:85077186683,Open governance and duality of technology: The open data designer-user disconnect in the Philippines,2-s2.0-85077186683,MOE,NRF-2017S1A5A2A01025690,Ministry of Education,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.29379/jedem.v11i2.545,,,2,94-118,eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077186683,11,,ar,Article

4292096,,0,Pongtaveekan N.,"© 2019 Natthaporn Pongtaveekan et al. Industrial cutting fluid wastewater (CFW) is considered as hazardous substance due to its detrimental effects to the environment and workers welfare. Treatment of this type of wastewater was sometimes disregarded due to lack of knowledge and resources. However, adsorption, a straightforward approach, was used in this study to address this problem. The feasibility of the bagasse and modified bagasse in the adsorption of CFW was determined. Varying the adsorbent dosage resulted in an increase in the percent adsorption, whereas a decline for the adsorption capacity at equilibrium using a single-stage batch laboratory- and pilot-scale adsorption. The point of zero charge of the bagasse and the modified bagasse was measured to be at pH 5.5 and 2.4, respectively. The experiment also determined that, for a liter of CFW, 10.2 g and 59.2 g of the modified bagasse are required under laboratory- and pilot-scale systems, respectively. Isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin were used in order to describe the adsorption process. It was determined that the surface heterogeneity and the pore size contributed to the adsorption of CFW; thus, Freundlich isotherm best fitted the data. Functional groups were verified using FTIR analysis and the heat of combustion, and their proximate analyses were determined. Based on the results under laboratory- and pilot-scale systems, modified bagasse is a viable material for the adsorption of CFW and solid fuel source.",SCOPUS_ID:85073617699,Using Bagasse and Aluminum Sulfate-Modified Bagasse as Adsorbents for Treatment of Industrial Cutting Fluid Wastewater in Laboratory and Pilot Scales,2-s2.0-85073617699,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1155/2019/4292096,,23144904,,,Journal of Engineering (United Kingdom),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073617699,2019,,ar,Article

8771114,Color filter array | context-free | Golomb-Rice | JPEG-LS | lossless compression | VLSI | wireless capsule endoscopy,0,Chen C.,"© 2013 IEEE. This paper presents a hardware-oriented lossless color filter array (CFA) image compression algorithm for very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit design. In order to achieve high performance, low complexity and low memory requirement, a novel lossless CFA image compression algorithm based on JPEG-LS is proposed for the VLSI implementation. A previous study showed the usage of a context table with its memory consuming more than 81% of the chip area for a JPEG-LS encoder design. The proposed algorithm implements a JPEG-LS-based lossless image compression algorithm that eliminates the use of the context technique and its memory in order to reduce the chip area while still maintaining its high performance. The proposed algorithm includes a pixel restoration, an adaptive Golomb-Rice parameter prediction and an improved Golomb-Rice coding technique. This paper was realized using a 0.18 μ m CMOS process with synthesized gate counts and core area of 4.8 k and 57, 625 μm2, respectively. The synthesized operating frequency of this design reached 200 MHz by using a pipeline scheduling technique. Compared with the previous JPEG-LS-based designs, this paper reduced the gate count to at least 28% and increased the average compression ratio by over 17.15% using the video endoscopy images from the Gastro Gastroenterologist Hospital.",SCOPUS_ID:85071156743,Lossless CFA Image Compression Chip Design for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy,2-s2.0-85071156743,MOST,MOST-107-2218-E-131-002,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930818,,,,107047-107057,IEEE Access,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071156743,7,,ar,Article
,,0,Lee Z.,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. In the era of information explosion, the production and collection of data is growing massively. Data mining is the process of finding valuable information in data. For imbalanced data, the majority classes have more instances than those of the minority classes. When data grows with imbalanced feature, the majority classes obtain main focus and will ignore the importance of the minority classes. It becomes hard and hard to solve these problems. Another obstacle for imbalanced data mining is the lack of skilled resources such as distributed mechanism. Thus, it is not easy to solve these problems by traditional algorithms of data mining such as decision tree, random forest and support vector machine. In this paper, a hybrid system based on support vector machine and Apache Spark is proposed to imbalanced data mining. In the proposed system, SVM with two approaches is proposed to implement on Apache Spark to parallel process imbalanced data. Two datasets from UCI repository are used to verify the correctness of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that the classification accuracy can be significantly promoted by the proposed system.",SCOPUS_ID:85070471055,A hybrid system for imbalanced data mining,2-s2.0-85070471055,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.1007/s00542-019-04566-1,,09467076,,,Microsystem Technologies,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070471055,,,ar,Article
,mixed-integer linear programming | multi-objective optimisation | multi-product value chain | rice value chain optimisation | spatio-temporal modelling,0,Doliente S.,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. The rice value chain, especially in the Philippines, can potentially progress in terms of efficiency and sustainability, as well as create more value by effectively utilising the crop residues of rice production. However, generating multiple products will lead to a complex decision-making process in supply chains, especially in the case of rice crop, which is vital for the Philippines’ food security. Thus, systematic planning techniques are needed to address important decisions along the stages in rice value chains. This study presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model developed for the planning, design and operation of multi-product rice value chains. In order to capture the spatial-dependencies of the problem, such as the candidate locations for rice farms and processing facilities, and location of demands, 81 cells represented the Philippines. The temporal aspect of the model considers a long planning horizon, out to 2050, and the time varying demands for white rice and the crop residues of farming and milling. The model determines design and operating decisions such as where to locate the farms and processing facilities, what products to produce, how to transport resources, among others. Different objectives are considered such as maximisation of the net present value and minimisation of CO2 emissions. The Pareto set generated represents the optimal solutions representing the different trade-offs between economic gain and environmental protection.",SCOPUS_ID:85069746230,"Multi-objective spatio-temporal optimisation for simultaneous planning, design and operation of sustainable and efficient value chains for rice crop",2-s2.0-85069746230,,undefined,,0,False,B9780128186343502435,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1016/B978-0-12-818634-3.50243-5,,15707946,,1453-1458,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069746230,46,,ch,Chapter
,Analyte | Cognitive impairment | IoT | pH level | pH transducer,6,Cruz R.,"© International Research Publication House. World Health Organization (WHO) reports show rapidly increasing death rates brought about by chronic illnesses. This scenario calls for possible remedies and interventions to minimize such occurrences. A possible avenue of addressing this is the provision of an immediate monitoring system using an application to determine pH levels which can keep track of an individual’s vital signs even in a remote area. The pH transducers transform the pH value into a current signal which is connected to a current controlled voltage source circuit that generates a potential difference. Also, this project utilizes a customized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based IoT architecture which uses a low-cost, low power and secure communication infrastructure called as Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This research aims to develop a diverse and productive research program in IoT, Long Range (LoRa) implementations and an FPGA-based system which can monitor the vital signs of a patient to eventually facilitate the needed immediate medical attention and service; and to utilize LoRa for a subscription-free and long-range bio-telemetry to healthcare providers. The study provides for different human activities and identified pH levels in their sweat. Each pH level sample produces a variance of the current signal. This research project entails to benefit both the patients as to consciousness of their physical well-being, equipping them to handle themselves prior receiving of medical attention; and for clinical practitioners for an immediate facility or signal to keep tract of patients’ physical condition.",SCOPUS_ID:85068610618,IoT-based monitoring model for pre-cognitive impairment using pH level as analyte,2-s2.0-85068610618,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,,,09743154,5,711-718,International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068610618,12,,ar,Article

,,0,Amer-Yahia S.,"© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). We present GroupTravel, a framework that generates customized travel packages (TPs) for a group of individuals. GroupTravel implements different consensus functions proposed in group recommendation to reach agreement among members. Given a group whose members provide a travel query, GroupTravel returns k Composite Items (CIs) of Points Of Interest (POIs) that are valid, representative, cohesive and personalized. Validity is achieved by satisfying the query expressed by the group. Representativity ensures good coverage of a city. Cohesiveness reflects geographic proximity of POIs forming a CI. Personalization is achieved by choosing POIs that best match the travel preferences of group members. Additionally, group members can interact with generated TPs to customize them. With extensive synthetic experiments and user studies, we examine the benefit of personalization and the impact of different group consensus on user satisfaction. We also show that providing the ability to interact with TPs and reflecting that in the consensus yields better TPs.",SCOPUS_ID:85064909765,GroupTravel: Customizing travel packages for groups,2-s2.0-85064909765,,undefined,,0,False,,Conference Proceeding,2019-01-01,10.5441/002/edbt.2019.13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783893180813'}]",,,133-144,Advances in Database Technology - EDBT,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064909765,2019-March,,cp,Conference Paper

Science and engineering departments face high student attrition due to perceived difficulty of courses in these disciplines. To subdue student attrition, students need to be guided by individual tutors to help them learn, practice and test their understanding of concepts. However, due to the exorbitant cost and time involved, this is not practical. In this article, we argue that computer-based tutors authored by teachers can serve as a useful tool to assist student learning in challenging scientific concepts. About 8,000 fine-grained interactions with our tutor by 72 students in two countries—USA and Philippines—were analysed in the framework of learning curve theory to estimate prior knowledge, learning rate and residual error rate to gauge tutor efficiency. Computer-based tutors accelerate learning and such tutors are viable, effective, and facile options to improve student learning.",SCOPUS_ID:85064818517,Efficient learning with intelligent tutoring across cultures,2-s2.0-85064818517,,undefined,,1,True,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.18844/wjet.v11i1.4007,,13091506,1,30-37,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064818517,11,,ar,Article
,Field | Habitus | Pierre Bourdieu | Practice | Preservation | Video game,0,Olgado B.,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. This paper presents a Bourdieuvian way of understanding video game preservation as a nascent field with its discourse and praxis shaped by ontological differences and conflicting power structures. This is illustrated through a spectrum of valuation that treats video games as material artifacts on one end and embraces its ephemerality on the other. Video game preservation literature and initiatives are likely to lean towards one of these extremes which focuses either on ensuring the playability of games or documenting of gameplay and its expressions. These competing values and practices can be seen further by classifying and mapping out participants, illustrating power relations. There are points of overlap and tensions between industry players, cultural institutions, and fans given their respective conflicting nature, intent, and mechanisms when it comes to video game preservation. The shape and sustainability of this emerging field and frontier, the paper posits in the end, depend on how these tensions are addressed, hopefully towards inclusion and collaboration.",SCOPUS_ID:85064035869,Save Point/s: Competing Values and Practices in the Field of Video Game Preservation,2-s2.0-85064035869,,undefined,,0,False,,Book Series,2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-15742-5_39,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': '9783030157418'}]",03029743,,411-418,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064035869,11420 LNCS,,cp,Conference Paper

This research assesses the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as it affects the perception of millennials regarding the socially responsible corporation that, in turn may influence their intention to purchase. The findings show that loyalty and trust appear stronger among olderage consumers than among the younger-age consumers, but both loyalty and authenticity are strong indicators of continuance intention. Younger-age consumers clearly analyzed authenticity to build trust and advocacy, whereas older-age consumer built trust with clearly communicated awareness of CSR initiatives. The managerial implications clearly highlight the importance of awareness for older-age consumers while authenticity was important for younger-age consumers. This offers opportunities for further development on the behavior of the two categoriews of consumers as well as strategies for practitioners to employ CSR to influence continuous purchases.",SCOPUS_ID:85056103367,Youth perception of corporate social responsibility: Does concern about social impact convert to consumption?,2-s2.0-85056103367,,undefined,,0,False,,Journal,2019-01-01,10.4018/IJABIM.2019010101,,19479638,1,1-25,International Journal of Asian Business and Information Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056103367,10,,ar,Article
