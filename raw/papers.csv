,Analyzing Gaze Patterns of Individuals in Programming Pairs,2019,"Eye tracking, pair programming, gaze patterns","Gaze patterns of individuals in programming pairs were analyzed as they traced and debugged fragments of code. This was done through a dual eye tracking experiment by recording the individual participants’ fixations and computing their gaze-based measures. The individuals in the pairs were categorized into a more successful and less successful participant based on the number of bugs found. The eye movement patterns were classified under the more and less successful participants. These gaze patterns were linked to how these individual participants read or traced source codes and searched for errors. Results and evidence suggest that there were indeed differences between the more successful and less successful participants in programming pairs. These findings tell us which behaviors and practices are exhibited by the more successful participants in the pairs in a bug-finding task. Programming instructors can learn from these practices and can give practical tips to the more struggling students in programming.","Maureen M. Villamor, Ma. Mercedes T. Rodrigo"
,Developing Art from Art: Towards Affective Music Composition Based on Curated Artworks Using a Genetic Algorithm,2019,"Abstract Paintings, Music Generation, Computational Music","This is a study on affective image-based music composition generated from abstract paintings using a genetic algorithm. It aims to effectively generate music that will showcase the mood of various abstract paintings to enhance people's experience when viewing these types of artworks by producing music that is generated algorithmically by analyzing the painting based on the rule of thirds. This study uses various findings on the relationship between color and musical properties to translate these image features into a melody that is both pleasing to hear and fits the mood of the original artwork. Image analysis is performed using the OpenCV library. For music generation, a modified implementation of the genetic algorithm by Delahousse is used. The algorithm generates a population of 50 melodies in each generation. After 200 generations, the program outputs the melody with the highest fitness score. This study was then tested on 33 participants. Results show that the mood of nervousness is eventually relieved when a painting is viewed with the generated accompanying music.","Deion C.

,Blind Deconvolution Model for Scene Text Localization and Recognition,2019,"Image deblurring, text localization, text recognition, blind
deconvolution","Extracting correct texts from scene images offers more technological development possibilities. Text localization and detection in scene images are two crucial components in retrieving content-based information. This textual information provides valuable details that could be beneficial towards a clearer understanding on the high-level semantics and contents of different multimedia - scene text images as such. This study mainly explores on how can blind deconvolution be applied to improve text localization and recognition of texts in both clear and blurry datasets. ICDAR 2011 and ICDAR 2013 datasets are used as inputs for text localization and text recognition. Blurry datasets are generated from the two datasets by applying a specific Gaussian blur kernel to each of the images of both datasets. Experimental results show that the currently proposed method provides competitive text localization and
recognition performance on both blurry and clear datasets.","Clarisa Albarillo, Proceso Fernandez, Jr"

,Exploring Photorealistic Rendering For Mixed Reality On Mobile Devices,2019,"Augmented Reality, Computer Graphics, Rendering","This work investigates the possibility of photorealistic rendering of virtual objects for mixed reality applications on mobile devices. Photorealistic rendering refers to the process of seamlessly merging virtual objects into real-world scenes. Most systems implemented for this purpose require complex setups, heavy user input, and powerful hardware. Furthermore, very few of these systems have considered implementation for mobile devices especially through global illumination as mobile devices present limited computational power compared to modern desktop machines. The developed system renders virtual objects onto real scenes using physically based rendering approaches and global illumination in the form of path tracing. These rendering approaches were then evaluated in terms of photorealistic quality in the form of a qualitative survey and performance through performance testing on mobile devices to gather which physically based rendering approaches produce the best results. Results show that it is indeed possible to implement photorealistic rendering on a mobile device that employs physically based rendering and global illumination and that there are indeed better rendering approaches that produce better photorealistic quality than others. This work also shows that photorealistic rendering for mixed reality can be implemented on limited mobile device hardware using the Unity Engine and its standard and compute shaders.","Christian Terrence Esguerra, Conrado Ruiz, Jr."
,CUAP: A Software Package for the Codon Usage Patterns Analysis,2019,"Codon usage, synonymous codon, nuclear genes, eukaryotic genes, software, maximum likelihood estimation","Codon Usage Analysis Package (CUAP) is a web-based software for the analysis of eukaryotic nuclear codon usage patterns using Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters of a Multinomial Distribution (MLEMD) as a new approach for estimating codon usage preference. It can calculate the codon usage based on MLEMD and outputs a codon usage table of DNA sequences that identifies the preferred codon per amino acid. Unlike other online tools that implements other indices in measuring the non-random usage of synonymous codons in a gene and between organisms, CUAP implements MLEMD approach that gives statistical analysis as evidenced by the calculated standard error after codon analysis. This software is developed using R, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It will be highly useful for biologists, statisticians and computer scientists involved in biological research.

,Exceptional Learners Motivation for Better Performance thru Game-based Learning System,2019,"Exceptional learners, Motivation, Performance, Gamification, Learning system","Special education is a distinctive education provision, for students with disabilities and disorders. It aims to enhance the behavior of the students through giving reinforcements and many different teaching methods and strategies. Exceptional learners are those students with learning and behavior issues, having physical disabilities, and those intellectually talented. Computer game is progressively a part of the day-to-day activities of learners of all ages. There were researches that were cited that could support student motivation and learning that is why its implementation in the classroom can be very challenging. Gamification incorporates computer game elements like leaderboards, badges, and points into non-game contexts in order to take benefit of the motivation provided by an artificial intelligence environment. A study was conducted to find out to what extent gamification aids student motivation and accomplishment among exceptional learners. Incorporating elements of gamification into exceptional learners’ environments can support student motivation and achievement. Game-based learning resulted to increase of class participation and appearance, and it is absolutely correlated with student performance improvement. The user acceptability test was used to determine the proficiency of the system to help the teachers in teaching exceptional learners in the approach of their learning. To be able to test the acceptability of the developed system, the researchers floated an acceptability questionnaire to stakeholders where the target user enjoys exploring the content of the system. Based on their rating, the researchers motivated to enhance the functionality of the system. The target user strongly agrees with a ratio of 4.5, which means that the system has the functionality needed in their school process.","Christian dela Cruz, Thelma Palaoag"

Analysis","The transportation network all over the world is still one of the prevailing concerns of the commuters. Most of the available route transportation system focused on finding the shortest path, the cheapest fare, or the safest route. Also, the number of developed multimodal public transportation recommendation system is lesser than the private or public unimodal transportation applications. To assist the commuters on having an efficient way of using the different mode of transport (PUJ, Bus, Train) in Metro Manila, Philippines, the researchers aim to develop an intelligent multimodal route recommendation system which focuses on the three best user’s commuting perspectives (three best shortest path, three cheapest fare, and real-time traffic updates). This application will be developed using the Open Trip Planner API, Open Street Map API, Sakay.ph GTFS data and text analysis. The proposed application has a server that collects the latest traffic related tweets of MMDA in the most congested road in Metro Manila (EDSA, Circumferential Road 5 and Commonwealth) and pre-processed using the text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, frequency counting, and removal of unnecessary characters). The cleaned data will be categorized into six topic segments (Day, Time, Lane of Road, Road Direction, Location and Trafffic Mode) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Also, this research differentiates four machine learning models (Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Tree, and
k-Nearest Neighbor) to identify the best performing algorithm in terms of classifying the traffic congestion modes (Light, Light to Moderate, Moderate, Moderate to Heavy, and Heavy). Based from the result of the experiment k-NN performed best performance among Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree with an 84% classification accuracy in producing a reliable real-time traffic updates in Metro Manila, Philippines.","Erika Ritzelle P.

,A Randomized Data Obfuscation Approach for Cluster Analysis,2019,"data obfuscation, cluster analysis, column randomization, k-means, data visualization, cluster retention, inertia difference, multiparty obfuscation","Businesses nowadays rely on data because it can be turned into actionable insights that can lead to cost reduction, better decision making, and new products and services. With data analytics, businesses can gain a competitive advantage. However, there is a growing need to protect classified data such as business transactions and records. Privacy breaches caused by third parties may cause a lot of distrust in businesses if their data is ever mishandled. These attacks can be avoided through data obfuscation. Data obfuscation is a technique used to distort data in order to hide information. The data is purposely modified in order to prevent someone unauthorized to have access to classified information. This paper evaluates variations of the Column Randomization technique, which are 2-Column Randomization, M-Column Randomization, and N-Column Randomization. Two datasets were used in order to test the consistency of the results. Cluster analysis is used as the machine learning method against which these techniques are evaluated. Each variation of the technique is evaluated by measuring how close the resulting clusters of the original and the obfuscated data are and how hard it is to reverse the
obfuscated data using various criteria. Results show that the best case of the M-Column Randomization technique yields obfuscated data that is not only usable but is also hard to reverse. Results also show that the optimal delta in using this technique is 0.75 regardless of the importance of the columns to be obfuscated.","Gabriel K. De Jesus, Carlo D. Mendoza, Alyssa Nicole N.

,A Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Multi-Floored Un-Equal Area Facility Layout Design Evaluated Using a Movement Cost Function,2019,,"This study is focused on developing a system that creates an Optimal Facility Layout by integrating an existing paper’s manual process of positioning departments to promote productivity into a modification of another paper’s Genetic Algorithm that solves the facility layout problem and evaluating layouts using a movement cost function. An optimal building layout for its
departments results in less foot-traffic which results in a lower movement cost. While there are already existing studies that used the Genetic Algorithm to solve the Facility Layout Problem, most of these systems generate layouts for only one floor, and with equal department dimensions. There are few studies that explore the generation of building layouts for arbitrary set floors and area dimensions. The integration of Padgaonkar’s [5] movement cost function to a modified version of Misola and Navarro’s [3] Genetic Algorithm results in a generic Genetic Algorithm that solves the Facility Layout Problem for facilities that are multi-floored and have un-equal area departments.","Katrina B.

This is usually affected by both the experience of the musician and the sheet music he or she is playing. This experiment used eyetracking to check which elements in music slow down sight-reading speed. Results did show that not only two music elements but also prior experience slowed down and affected sight-reading speed of a certain musician.","Christian Chan, Jose Mirabueno, Justin San Pedro, Andrei Coronel"

We present and compare two Bayesian Networks constructed using alternative methods: one was constructed manually using domain knowledge, and the other BN was constructed using structural learning algorithms. Both networks were designed using examination results collected from 80 student-respondents. This data was used by the parameter learning algorithm to determine the conditional probability distributions of the nodes. Our analysis after performing parameter learning algorithm have shown that the resulting BN's beliefs are close to the beliefs defined in the manually constructed BN. However the BN constructed using structural learning algorithms was substantially different and we present our findings in this paper.","Teresita C. Limoanco, John Paul S. Guzman, Raymund C. Sison"

,Mango Variety Recognizer Using Image Processing and Artificial Neural Network,2019,"Backpropagation, moment invariants, texture analysis, thresholding","Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is considered in the Philippines as one of its most important fruit crops in terms of values and exports. Selecting the right variety of mango to plant is critical in mango production industry. Variety recognition is considered an essential tool for ensuring quality product. Human experts can do recognition but in their absence, technology cannot be put into good use. This paper developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) type of neural network application that can identify a mango variety from a leaf image of any of the four predominant mango varieties of the Philippines: Carabao, Pico, Pahutan and Katchamita. Nine color features, nine textural features and seven Hu moments morphological features were extracted from each leaf image samples using different image processing techniques such as the automatic thresholding method of segmentation, median filter, dilation and erosion. The MLP has 25 neurons in the input layer, 50 neurons in the hidden layer and 4 neurons in the output layer. The recognizer was tested with 40 leaf images (10 samples for each variety) from the samples used in the training and 40 leaf images that were not used in the training. The test obtained an accuracy of 96%.","Winston M. Tabada, Jerik G. Beltran"
